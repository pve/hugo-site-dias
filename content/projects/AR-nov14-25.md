Subject: When being a professional is not enough

I have worked with many people who felt stuck in their professional lives.

Often these were people having outstanding professional skills in cloud computing, security, IT architecture, artificial intelligence, and more.

These also don't lack ambition.

Yet, they feel unable to progress in the direction they want.
They have a strong feeling that they should be capable of more than what they achieve.

What is worse, they can often see what the organizations that they are in could be doing better.

This tension can motivate better work.
But if it does not lead to results, it becomes stifling.

And this hurts, because they still have so much professional life left in them.

These frustrations have different outlets.
Some blame themselves, some blame their bosses, or their bad luck.

And it has a bad effect on their self-esteem, their job satisfaction, and sometimes even on the ones they love.

I feel your pain, I have been there.

What if there is a different way? What if there is a way out of that?

For many people there is, even though there is no magic key or wand to solve all problems.
For example, in my career I have changed directions a number of times.
One major example of that was when I discovered that my ambition to be good at certain skills was not matched by the actual skills.
Instead, my skills around digital infrastructures came natural to me, and they turned out to be very valuable.
What I initially discounted as too trivial, even boring, has turned into the cornerstone of a very fulfilling business. More about that in my book "How Digital Infrastructures at scale lead to value, power, and risk".

But it is not always easy: it requires asking yourself the right questions, and accepting new realities.

Let me hear your story, maybe I can shed some light on it.

Email me in private, and I'll get back to you.
