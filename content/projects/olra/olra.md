Overwhelmed by too many risks and controls to consider?
That is why there is this risk navigator.

The [OWASP LLM top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/) risks are a good start for analyzing the risks of an LLM system.

But, who is supposed to do each control? And which role do they have?

This is where allocation of risks and their controls to roles comes in, and why this tool is called the OLRA navigator.
OLRA stands for **OWASP LLM Risk Allocation**.

For more detail refer to the [AI roles](/content/book/diginfra/ai-roles.md).

The [OLRA Navigator](/olra/artifact3.html) lists a very preliminary set of controls by actor.

More coming soon!
