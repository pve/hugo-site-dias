IT has not much value of itself, but it is a tool to create value elsewhere.

Often IT is about controlling a process better.

With more information about, for example, prospective customers, you can make them better offers. 

With more information about the temperatures of your house, you can heat or cool it more efficiently.

With more information about stock, you can run better logistics.

IT can also be a way to automate processes. This can make them better and cheaper.

This has been an important reason to invest in IT for many decades.

These days, AI is an additional approach to processing lots of information, which has a lot of potential for additional value.

As an IT or risk professional, you should be able to explain how investments in IT lead to value elsewhere.
That is part of being a professional, and it also helps to fund the work that you think is important.

I have collected the best parts of my years of consulting experience on real projects into my book Digital Power: How Digital Infrastructures at Scale lead to Value, Power, and Risk.

Here are some sections from the book that are relevant to this story:
