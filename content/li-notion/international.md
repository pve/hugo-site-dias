Digital sovereignty is concerned with which international actors can limit the independence of a country.

But what really are the international actors?

Without an answer to that question, the search for digital sovereignty will become difficult and ambiguous.

There are many differing opinions on that topic, which makes that a hard question.

I elaborate on a few of these opinions in my book: Digital Power: how digital infrastructures at scale lead to value, power, and risk.

The book is available free online or as a paperback on Amazon.
