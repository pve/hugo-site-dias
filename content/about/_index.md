Hi! I'm Peter van Eijk, and I am an instructor, coach and consultant.

We often think of digital infrastructures as neutral technical systems. But they aren’t just roads; they’re rulebooks. They define who benefits, who is exposed to risk, and who holds power. From cloud platforms to AI, these infrastructures shape our world—but we rarely think about them systematically. This book will give you a new way to see and navigate them.

This is a book in progress.
