We often think of digital infrastructures as neutral technical systems. But they aren’t just roads; they’re rulebooks. They define who benefits, who is exposed to risk, and who holds power. From cloud platforms to AI, these infrastructures shape our world—but we rarely think about them systematically.

Hi! I'm Peter van Eijk, and I am an instructor, coach and consultant. For most of my career I have been working on IT and how to control it, and its risks. After a variety of jobs I started my own business in 2005 to focus on consulting and teaching on Digital Infrastructures.

On this site I am now collecting, organizing, and updating many of the writings I have done over the past years.

With a bit of luck and planning, this can be structured in a book that gives you a new way to see and navigate Digital Infrastructures.

Watch it come together, and please share your thoughts with me.

Find me on LinkedIn (Peter HJ van Eijk) for inquiries about coaching, consulting, and workshops.
