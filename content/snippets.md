Wat is server en client? Bij X is bijvoorbeeld de server op de client.

Oh ja, die discussie. Ben je verantwoordelijk als je onveilige software maakt, of alleen als je die als service beschikbaar stelt?

How technical debt works: negative investment externalities.

But of course you have this discussion on shared services. As a matter of fact, I keep talking about the book that I'm probably not going to finish, but it's still a nice frame of reference. Now digital infrastructures at scale - there are a few very essential elements in there. The most important elements are: one, that you have a separation between a provider and multiple consumers; and two, that that service is digital, which means that it's amenable to automation. These two together give a really interesting socio-political economic dynamic. And that's what you need to understand if you want your shared service to keep operating - or if you don't want it to operate, but that's a different story.

Technology power shifts:
In the early 90s I saw the PC revolution come up and shortly afterwords client-server computing, including all the things that went wrong.
A little later, the Internet revolution from boom to bust, and back up again.
Then, early 10s, cloud computing exploded, and I started teaching cloud security.
All of these led to dramatic shifts of power in organizations, and therefore in the way IT was organized. Here I'd like to explore the underlying mechanisms.
