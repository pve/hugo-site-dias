This book has been more than thirty years in the making.
The two main reasons for that, as I look back on that now, are that the field of information has been developing so rapidly, and that I did not see the opportunity in my business to create a focus for which writing a book would make business sense. And if I did, the focus never seemed to last very long.

Instead I wrote smaller pieces from time to time, as well as lots of short educational materials, triggered by a need from my learners.

I did try to create a larger organised collection of knowledge, and even had a basic taxonomy in place, and raw input. But the dynamics of my professional live continuously outran my plans to turn it into a book.

I have occupied myself with IT for over half a century now, arguably most of that in a professional capacity. For a substantial part of that time, I have been searching for some focus. It took me until the turn of the millenium to finally get some expression of that in the form of a professional branding statement. It went something like this.

_Peter van Eijk is an innovative ICT strategist who makes connections between business, people and technology. With wit and confrontation he guides you to new approaches. He is inimitably hard core Internet oriented, yet never forgets that communication is between people, not machines._

That message has served me well for a long time. And in fact it was the basis for the name of the business I set up in 2005: "Digital Infrastructures".
I would like to think that I made up that phrase, because it has taken up a life on its own on a much larger scale, but in 2005 there was already a small IT company serving the local dentists in Oregon by that name. But I am fairly confident that through my former colleagues its use has accelerated.

Still, "Digital Infrastructures" is too broad a concept for an attractive book. "Cloud Computing" was a term with much wider appeal, at is has served me well. My business pivoted to cloud security training, which I have delivered in many countries over many years to many people.

Cloud computing resonates with me, because it blends technology with business, and you need to understand both in order to truely understand cloud computing.

To help develop this I took a side job as Associate Professor Cyber Security and Cloud at the Hogeschool Utrecht. It greatly helped my thinking in how to bring professional IT skills to the next generation.

But all good things come to an end.

Technology develops in waves, and cloud computing is now mainstream.

The demise of my training business, over the pandemic, also leads me to rethink my professional focus.

Then, as the evolving cloud computing business models saturates the market while at the same time geopolitical tensions expand the battlefield into the digital domain.
