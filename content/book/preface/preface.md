This is hardly a book on digital technology, but more on the organisational and societal impact of managing this at scale. 

For a better understanding of digital technology I highly recommend Brian Kernighan’s “Understanding the Digital World”. () And if you want to have fun while learning how to understand software, I’d highly recommend “The Nature of Code” by Daniel Schiffman ().

As you will find out in this book, I am putting on some very specific lenses to look at the world. You may find them restrictive; you may find them arbitrary(?), you may find them opiniated. Yes, this specific way of looking at the effects of digital technology has its limits. However, the essence of understanding is to be able to extract the core elements out of something. Paradoxically, only by restricting the way we look at things can we see more clearly. Cut through the noise. Like Goethe said: “In der Beschränkung zeigt sich erst der Meister”, though he applied that to a different subject. 

I have a very limited perspective of the world. There are so many things and concepts that I just fail to remember or understand. 
And yet, that limitation has served me well. It has allowed me to focus on core principles that you may not see if you take in all the richness and idiosyncrasies. 
My limited perspective can serve you as a map. And you know that every map is not equal to the terrain it covers. In fact, the purpose of the map is to extract only the most relevant features of the terrain. How good a map is, judgement on the quality of the map is not objective. It is dependent on what you use the map for. A railroad map is close to useless if you navigate by car or boat. 
That is why you should consider the models and the perspectives that I give you as maps to guide your journey. If they bring you where you want to be, great! If not, get a different map. 

As you will see, the core elements of the models I find useful revolve around interactions between autonomous agents that process information. These agents typically have limited (bounded) capabilities. (link to maps as means to reduce attention requirements). These agents can be humans, software or AI agents.

As I believe that you are an autonomous agent as well, it is up to you to decide how useful these models and stories are for your practice. You will not find answers to every question that you have around digital infrastructures. Where possible and relevant I will point you to other views, stories and explanations. At the same time, you may find my maps to be also useful for domains that are outside the digital.
