A great way to look at how value is created in interactions between autonomous actors is game theory.

I have found this to be an effective model, or map, to think about the outcomes of sequences of interactions.

A game, in this view, has a number of *players*, who make *moves* that result in *payoffs*. The payoffs are defined by the rules of the game.

A simple example is tic-tac-toe, where players take turns (make moves) in marking an X or O on a 3x3 board.
Whoever has three in a row first wins (the payoff).

The digital infrastructures world has lots of examples and applications of this.
Let's start by looking at a simple provider-consumer relationship.

The provider pools resources such as bandwidth and servers to multiple consumers, and charge a certain price to them.
The move they make is setting a price and the size of the pool.

The consumers' moves, simply stated, are to buy the service from this provider, or not.

The rules of the game, if you could say so, are that the more consumers use the pool, the less performance they get.

The payoff for the provider is the amount of revenue they get. More users means more revenue. The payoff for the consumers is the performance they get.
