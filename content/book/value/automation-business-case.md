IT is about automation, but not all automation brings value.

This XKCD graphic illustrates when automating repeating tasks, or even just parts of them, brings benefit.

![XKCD 1205](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png)

The objective of this diagram is to show how much time you can invest in automating tasks.
You can think of tasks such as:

- shaving 3 web clicks off a workflow
- converting a spreadsheet to another data format
- making an appointment
- looking up some research
- running a test
- installing a new version of a piece of software
- saving a piece of evidence for an audit

Such manual tasks can be made shorter, or made to disappear all together with a bit more automation.
The top row of the diagram indicates how often that task is done.
The left column shows how much time the automation would save, per individual execution of the task.

Each cell in the table then shows the amount of effort that you can spend on that automation and still have a net positive outcome over five years.
The black cells, by the way, are 'impossible' situations.
For example, you cannot execute a 1 hour task 50 times a day, according to this table.
This is only true, in my opinion, if you assume only one person doing that task.
If a whole team can benefit from the automation, there would be useful numbers in those cells as well.

Another way of talking about this is that each cell shows what investment would have a five year *break-even point*, that is: if you spend this amount of time on it, the break-even point will be five years.
If only half the investment is necessary, the break-even point will be two and a half years. If only a tenth of the investment is necessary, the break-even point will be 6 months.

For example, if I have a one minute improvement in a task that I do daily, than about two hours of investment in that will be paid back in about 6 months.

Of course this is a simple way of looking at those business cases.
This does not take into account other costs or benefits.
A couple of examples of that:

- computer usage is not included as a cost
- maintenance over the five year period is not included
- the use case you are automating could change drastically in five years, making your automation obsolete
- automation often leads to more consistent quality especially as you use it more often, a great example of that is in automated testing

But all of that is not the big point.
The big point is: automate, and in particular automate those tasks where the benefit is totally obvious and massive.
