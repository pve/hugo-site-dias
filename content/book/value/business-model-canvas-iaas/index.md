## Business Model Canvas

The business model canvas is a visual template for developing and discussion business models. For more information see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas> and <http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/>

The business model canvas has nine basic building blocks and specific relations between those building blocks. I'll illustrate them here.

The example used in this section is Amazon Web
Services (AWS), in particular EC2 (virtual machines on demand). This is an Infrastructure as a
Service offering. The power of the business model canvas approach will become clear if we see how it
can distinguish between various cloud service offerings.

## Customer segments (CS)

Customer segments are the groups of customers that the company ultimately serves, I.e. the ones
that consume and pay for the services.

In the AWS case, although basically anybody with a credit card can spin up a virtual machine, in 2015 it looked
like Amazon was primarily targeting software developers and (startup) SaaS providers as the main
customers. Historically, the Amazon development teams where the first customers. External
customers were initially added as an afterthought.

## Value Propositions (VP)

The value propositions reflect the customer problems and needs. This is the central element that
describes why the customer would ultimately pay for the product or service.

The value proposition of a cloud computing service is driven by its five essential characteristics. 
For example
in the AWS EC2 case, the core component of the value proposition is rapid self-service provisioning of
virtual machines with pay per use billing. For each individual customer these translate into different
business advantages. An example is fast provisioning, reduced capital expenditure, and reduced risk of over-investing.

## Channels (CH)

Value propositions are delivered to customers through communications, distribution and sales
channels.

It is often assumed that cloud computing relies solely self-service direct sales, but the reality is much
more diverse. SaaS providers in particular are developing extensive partner programs.
AWS primarily employs a self-service direct model, where the delivery is through APIs. The model is
enanced by premium support.

## Customer Relationships (CR)

Customer relations are established and maintained with each specific customer segment.

One of the ways that AWS maintains relationships with its customer segments is through conferences.
The 2013 re:Invent developer conference attracted 9000 visitors. In 2024 the conference, no longer solely focussed on developers, drew around 60.000 visitors. Additionally, there are vibrant on-line
communities.

## Revenue Streams (RS)

Revenue streams are the result of value propositions that are successfully offered to customers.

The structure of revenue streams is where cloud computing differs from earlier IT service models, as
they are usage based rather than asset based.
AWS basically charges hourly fees per virtual machine. The bigger the virtual machine, the higher the
hourly rate.

## Key Resources (KR)

Key resources are the assets required to offer and deliver the previously mentioned elements (e.g.
value proposition, customer relationships).

AWS owns massive amounts of hardware, estimated at 1 million servers or more in 2015. That is housed in
dozens of data-centers worldwide. But there is more. The service can only be delivered through
advanced and unique fulfillment software and processes.

## Key Activities (KA)

The key resources perform key activities.

At AWS the key activity, delivery, is highly automated. But at the AWS scale, oversight and resources
planning is still a serious effort. Optimizing assets versus utilization is very essential in the IaaS
business model. Through economies of scale, AWS is able to spend a lot of effort on these activities.

## Key Partnerships (KP)

Some activities are outsourced, and some resources are acquired outside the enterprise.

AWS buys immense amounts of hardware, and uses a lot of (open source) software. Building out data
centers is also likely to be outsourced.

## Cost Structure (CS)

All business model elements discussed above impact the cost structure.

In more traditional IT service models the revenue streams are tightly coupled to the cost structure. The
cloud computing innovation is also about decoupling these.
At AWS the main cost elements are in assets such as servers and data centers, in services such as
electrical power and telecommunications, and in people for managing the systems.

## Summary

The business model canvas is a good tool to map out the particularities of cloud provider business
models. In this section we have only looked at the basics of a particular infrastructure provider. For
software-as-a-service providers and internal/private cloud providers, the canvas can also
be used to discuss their differences.
