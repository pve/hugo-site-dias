Trust is an essential element in any collaboration.
We want to trust things, people, and organisations to do the right thing, to keep their promises.
Without trust, we will not be able to have confidence in the contribution of others, and that is a risk.

Anything we don't trust is a risk.
Anytime we assume trust that is not warranted is also a risk.
That is one of the core concepts of Zero Trust Security Architecture.

Trust is an elusive concept, but I do have a couple of ways of looking at it that I have found very useful.
One is from "the Prisoner's Dilemma," which is a story from game theory.
Another is "authority," which is related to that, basically "I trust somebody, because somebody tells me so". 

Trust can also be something that is fairly technical, as in: can I trust the webserver to be up all the time?
