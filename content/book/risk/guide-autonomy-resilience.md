Imagine, you are part of the government of a medium sized nation, and you have just realized that IT has become a substantial factor in your operation.
Or you have a similar position in a manufacturing industry, or in the financial sector.
As IT increased in volume, you have tried to keep its costs down.
Outsourcing to more experienced partners was an option, and so was the use of cloud computing, for example for your Office applications.

Now you realize that IT is not just a cost, but that it is also existentially important to your business.

No IT, no business.

This is no longer about cost. It is about survival.

The geopolitical situation and the monopolistic dominance of big tech, are creating a massive challenge.
In the west, we are talking about the US government and the three big hyperscalers. In the east, it is China and their big companies.
All these actors have demonstrated that they can and will exert their influence counter to the interest of IT consumers.

Cloud computing has aggravated the situation.
Where vendor lock-in was already an issue in the early days of computing, most companies could operate independently from their vendors for a while.
In a cloud world, service can stop from one minute to another.

Hence the call for more sovereignty and autonomy.

In this unit I want to develop a framework for structuring the conversation around business resilience, which I think is the umbrella concept here.

I propose to start with a risk based approach, focussing on the supply chain.
We start by identify the threats that the call for sovereignty and autonomy is supposed to address.

For example, a nation state order might force a cloud provider to cease operations for a specific customer.
This leads to an availability risk for that customer.
For example they cannot access their email anymore.

Mijn doel: meer handel doordat ik meer verstand van de materie heb. Mijn insteek: supply chain risk, en het houden van interviews met leveranciers die de motieven van klanten kennen, of die nu realistisch zijn of niet. 
AI stuff? 
Mijn hypothese / model: controleer of het risk begrip adequaat is, en kijk dan naar de controls die daar bij horen, en zie dan of je een reeks ‘technische’ controls kunt bedenken.
Paul/Mariano: like to start with EMEA, CCM check. 
What does soevereiniteit mean? 
. 
What type of risk/threat are you thinking of? (what are other people, or companies) Model this through a supply chain model.
Linda: Survey to hiperscalers.  Data location is not the answer?
