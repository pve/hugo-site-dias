## Controls

Microsoft: Countermeasure (or control). A safeguard that addresses a threat and mitigates risk.

what other assets?

Where did that file go?
Where did you leave that address?
Who changed your password?

Once we have assets and risks identified, we think of ways to minimize these risks.
Those ways are called controls or measures.
If you have read through an IT risk management book, many of these should be familiar.
For the rest of you, here is a brief outline of some control examples for data.

- Classification: organizing data in various categories. This could from public to top secret, with a few in between. This is not really a technical control, but rather a means to apply specific controls on that data.
- Labelling: similar to classification. Data labels can relate data to specific use cases, such as development versus production, specific applications or owners.

One neat way to organize risks is according to a data lifecycle model.

- Create: classify, label
- Store: encryption
- Use: logical controls
- Share: DLP, encryption
- Archive: asset management
- Destroy: crypto shredding (encrypting and deleting the key)
