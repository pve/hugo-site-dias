title: 'Intro to Risk'
---

In a digital world, it is not always easy to think through what risk is. While we can borrow a lot from the real world, certain important differences exist.

At the core of every risk assessment there is the thing we worry about the most: the '**asset**'.

In a digital world, this is often the **data**. Think business critical data, like our database of customers. Think data that we have a compliance obligation on, such as personal data. 

In information security, like the name implies, we mainly worry about the security of that data.

It is common to distinguish between availability, confidentiality, and integrity risks. All of these can be a risk to the business. 

Business processes run on data, and if they are not, they can typically improved by using more data. We cover that in more detail in another place. 

If the data is not available, the business process can suffer, and its value reduced.

If the data leaks out, the business process can suffer, and its value reduced.

If the data does not reflect the reality well enough, the business process can suffer, and its value reduced.
