Let's dive a little deeper into assets, which is typically data that we have risks on, though we can also see the processing power that we need as an asset.

From a risk analysis, the asset is the unit that we consider.
ENISA, the European Network Information Security Agency, is one of the many institutes in the world described IT risk management.
In a report on cloud security (reference) they identified a number of assets.
A few examples to illustrate the breadth of that are:

- A4. Intellectual property. This represents value to the organization owning it.
- A6. Personal data
- A14. Cloud service management interface 
- A17. Physical hardware
- A22. Security logs

## Vulnerabilities and threats

ENISA: Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact an asset 
Microsoft:
Threat. A potential occurrence, malicious or otherwise, that might damage or compromise your assets.
Vulnerability. A weakness in some aspect or feature of a system that makes a threat possible. Vulnerabilities might exist at the network, host, or application levels.
Attack (or exploit, leads to bad consequence). An action taken by someone or something that harms an asset. This could be someone following through on a threat or exploiting a vulnerability.

V1. AAA vulnerabilities (i.e. weak or reused passwords)
V4. Remote access to management interface
V5. Hypervisor vulnerabilities

(examples of all)

## Risk

ENISA: Risk is result of vulnerability 
Risk = Impact * Probability
 (ISC)2:
Availability: is the information adequately available when needed (time/place)?
Integrity: is the information adequate and correct enough?
Confidentiality: is the information only accessible to authorized persons?
Also known as AIC or CIA triad


ENISA example
For example:

A14. Cloud service management interface
+
V1. AAA vulnerabilities
Leads to 
R.11 Management interface compromise

## Controls

Microsoft: Countermeasure (or control). A safeguard that addresses a threat and mitigates risk.


To be continued.
