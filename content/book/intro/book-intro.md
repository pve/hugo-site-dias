# How Digital Infrastructures at scale create value, power, and risk: a field guide
The internet is a _digital infrastructure at scale_. Let’s unpack that for a moment. 

It is _digital_, because it moves bits between devices.

It is _at scale_, because it moves these bits between billions of devices ranging from websites to mobile phones to robot lawn mowers. (how many?) That is impressive technology, but what keeps that together is the _infrastructure_ part of it. That is what defines the relation between the consumers and the providers, and that is what we are exploring here, as I will show you later. 

Looking at it through the lens of infrastructures allows us to understand use cases, abuse cases, and how to define, build and manage things like the internet.

These digital infrastructures are everywhere, and they are important tools to create value and power. But at the same time, even because of this, they can also be great sources of risk.

Better understanding digital infrastructures at scale allows us to better navigate the digital world at large.

So, what are some of the characteristics of infrastructures? What is it that I am calling a digital infrastructure?

We are taking the internet as an example of a digital infrastructure because most people are familiar with it. 

Social media is another example, and one that uses the internet as a component. Similarly digital marketplaces are an example.
In the same way, the internet is also built on many other infrastructures: telecommunications, DNS, Number authorities. 
In the realm of IT management, there are many more examples of shared services. 
Because there are so many examples of digital infrastructures, it makes sense to explore the commonalities. That will make it a lot easier to create, analyze, control, and manage them.

How do the examples that I have mentioned deliver value to their users and other stakeholders? What are the mechanisms and principles in there? If we know a bit more about that, we could better engineer that value and the way it is delivered.

What are the power structures around digital infrastructures? Who are the stakeholders that influence them, or are influenced by them? This cuts both ways: it brings value and risk to the table. Stakeholders typically want to increase value and reduce risk to them. But interests may also be conflicting, and resources are never infinite. With more understanding of these power structures, we have another handle on value creation and risk reduction.

What are the risks associated with digital infrastructures, and what are the ways to organize our management of them? Obviously, there is a vast body of knowledge around that, for example in the space of cloud computing, and to an extent also around artificial intelligence. I am not going to treat all of that, instead I want to bring out some core principles that have helped me, my clients, and my students to navigate that. 

I think this story is of interest to many senior roles in IT and business. I have worked with consultants, policymakers, researchers, risk assessors, IT architects, digital business owners, students, teachers and other scholars. Giving these people some tools to use for their work would be gratifying. 

I don’t have final answers to all the questions that I can pose, and I cannot afford to wait until I have them. For that reason, I want to present the book as an ongoing project, for the time being, where I organize my thoughts and research in the form of blog posts, that at some point will be assimilated in the draft book.
