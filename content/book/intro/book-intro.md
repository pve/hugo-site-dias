# How Digital Infrastructures at scale create value, power, and risk.
## A field guide
The internet is a digital infrastructure at scale. Letâ€™s unpack that for a moment. 

It is digital, because it moves bits between devices.

It is at scale, because it moves these bits between billions of devices ranging from websites to mobile phones to robot lawn mowers. (how many?) That is impressive technology, but what keeps that together is the infrastructure part of it. That is what defines the relation between the consumers and the providers, and that is what we are exploring here, as I will show you later. 

Looking at it through the lens of infrastructures allows us to understand use cases, abuse cases, and how to define, build and manage things like the internet.

These digital infrastructures are everywhere, and they are important tools to create value and power. But at the same time, even because of this, they can also be great sources of risk.

Better understanding digital infrastructures at scale allows us to better navigate the digital world at large.

So, what are some of the characteristics of infrastructures? What is it that I am calling a digital infrastructure?

We are taking the internet as an example of a digital infrastructure because most people are familiar with it.
