Thanks for reading so far.
The version you are reading now is a work in progress.
Maybe it will never be fully finished, and if so, I am happy that you got a chance to read this version.

I sincerely hope that you have found some of your own experiences reflected, and that this book has been able to give you some actionable new insights.

I can't even imagine where to start in acknowledging all my fellow travelers on this road of discovery.
It includes fellow students, colleagues, clients, suppliers, business partners, family, friends, and so on.
You know the clich√©s, still they are true.

My exploration goes on.
