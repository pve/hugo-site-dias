Technologies are often called disruptive.
But what makes a technology truly disruptive?
What has made the PC a disruptive technology? Or artificial intelligence, for that matter?
And at what time did it become a disruptive technology?
While many would accept that AI was a very disruptive technology starting from 2022 onwards,
most of it was available much earlier. Gen AI, chatbots, etc.
Think of ELIZA, the 60s era psychology chatbot by Joseph Weizenbaum.

If we understand the mechanics better, we can begin the see how we can predict these shifts better.

While there are many uses of the word 'disruptive' in this context, I'd like to focus on the degree to which a disruptive technology will shift power in organisations and society.

In my professional career I have seen, as mentioned elsewhere, a few major disruptive changes.
Most of these, if not all, significantly changed power structures.

The mainframe was typically a central corporate strategic decision, necessitating a corporate IT department.
That also implies that conflicts around its use would percolate to the top. This is one of the essentials of corporate governance.

AI has been around for many years, even decades, but its use really took off after the introduction of a democratized tool that everybody could use: chatGPT.

Power dynamics shift when we introduce new actors in the ecosystem.
For example, minicomputers came within reach of department budgets, causing those departments to also start buying them. ChatGPT allowed people to try out GenAI and apply it to their work.

Affordable access introduces new buyers in the game. Freemium business models make that even more accessible. The game is that value from these services is demonstrated with a free proof of concept, which opens the discussion to talk about bigger budgets. It is part of GitLabs official pricing strategy.
