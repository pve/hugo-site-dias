Power does not automatically flow from those that have it to those that are influenced by it.

As they say in dutch, quoting the poet Willem Elschot?: "tussen droom en daad staan wetten in de weg, en praktische bezwaren". ("between dream and deed stand laws in the way, and practical objections").

We want to understand this. If we want to exercise power, we need to understand the intermediaries. If we want to subvert power, the intermediaries are one of our disruptive points.

The power broker is like the forward observer in an artillery unit. They don't have the power, but they definitely influence how it is applied. Knowledge is power, as they say.
