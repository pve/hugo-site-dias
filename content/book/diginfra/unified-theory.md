The units so far have explored quite a few, seemingly randomly related, concepts and observations.
Here we'll embed them in a unified theory that illustrates how they fit together.

At the core is the concept of promise-based interactions between autonomous agents (human and technical). Every digital infrastructure can be understood as a network of these promises:

1. Value Creation Layer

- Promises made to consumers about service delivery (availability, performance)
- Economic models showing how shared resources and automation create value
- Business model frameworks showing how promises translate to revenue streams

1. Power Distribution Layer

- Who makes which promises to whom (governance structures)
- How promises are enforced (contracts, standards, regulations)
- Control boundaries between agents (who decides what)
- How scale shifts power dynamics (Dunbar's number threshold effects)

1. Risk Management Layer

- Analyzing what happens when promises are broken
- Vulnerabilities in promise networks (security, compliance)
- Trust assumptions and zero trust principles
- How externalities distribute risk across stakeholders

1. Change Management Layer

- How promises evolve over time
- Feedback loops that stabilize or destabilize systems
- Technology maturity cycles (from manual to automated)
- Disruption patterns when new agents enter the ecosystem

This model shows how these layers interact - for example, how power structures affect what promises can be made (value), how those promises create potential failure points (risk), and how adaptive change processes respond to those risks.

For each real-world digital infrastructure (cloud computing, social media platforms, payment systems), the framework provides a consistent analytical approach that reveals the underlying dynamics shaping its development, adoption, and governance.

What makes this powerful is that it creates a universal language for understanding everything from a simple client-server relationship to complex multi-stakeholder global systems, while acknowledging both technical and social dimensions of digital infrastructures.
