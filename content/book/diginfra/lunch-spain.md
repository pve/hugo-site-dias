title: 'What a lunch in Spain taught me about digital infrastructures'
---

In 2005 I visited my father in France. It turned out to be convenient to pick me up from the Gerona airport in Spain.
And as we had enough time, we had lunch on the way.

At the restaurant's checkout I noticed a peculiar array of devices. There were four payment terminals.

I'd never seen that. From what I know, a merchant works with a bank which handles all their payments. Apparentely not over here.

A closer inspection revealed that each was associated with a different bank.
So apparently, depending on the bank that a **customer** of the restaurant works with, the restaurant needs to have a payment terminal associated with that. 

To me, this does not sound optimal for the merchant. It takes money and deskspace to accomodate all those different payment networks. The alternative is that the customer can't use their electronic payment system. That won't make them happy, and the last thing you want as a merchant is to have unhappy customers. 

An online payment system, in this case with cards and terminals, is an infrastructure. and arguably a digital infrastructure. It serves many users: customers, merchants, and in this case the bank. One infrastructure for each bank. 

I would argue that there is a benefit in having a digital infrastructure like this that serves most banks, instead of just one. For example, you would not have to replicate installation and maintenance of those payment terminals. And indeed, in the current day and age, it seems to be the normal thing to do.

But apparently, it was hard to get to such a common system. So hard in fact, that it made sense for the banks and the merchants to waste all that money on replicating an infrastructure and foregoing all the benefits of a shared system. 

There are a few hypotheses on why this is so.

Let's analyse this and see what causes this situation.

I'd like to bring into the perspective that services such as these eveolve. They don't come into existence and remain stationary forever. We'll also want to look at the actors involved and their objectives and possible actions. 

The actors involved (not even mentioning other stakeholders) include the bank(s), the merchants and the customers. These are the most impotant ones, on the level of the actual payments. (There are other stakeholders looking more toward the impact on society as a whole.)

The banks probably expected to reduce costs and have more happy merchants. And having this benefit earlier rather than later, probably compensated for the higher cost of building out your own digital infrastructure for your merchants.
