Your IT security vendor wants you to be scared.

There.

I said it.

I scared you about being scared.

But that is not how I want to talk to you.
I want to enable you to make better decisions faster, and I believe that better understanding of the essentials helps.
This allows you to act from a position of autonomy, which is one of my values.

In the history of IT security, unfortunately, fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) have always been effective sales tactics.
And it is no different in the world of AI.

The reason is clear.

It is in how people think.
Daniel Kahneman talks about two systems of thought: fast and slow.
The fast one is more emotional, and quick to respond to fear.
The slow one is more cognitive, and takes its time to think the situation through.

The first one helps you to survive, the second one helps you to develop and grow.

But, in IT security as in politics, if you do not make a conscious effort to deploy system two to a situation, the first system will win, even if it does not provide the best long term result.
In many fields, professionals are trained, even drilled, to use the second system when a crisis arises.
Think healthcare emergency responders, airline pilots, and combat soldiers.

That is my challenge in writing about IT and IT security: I am not very good at scaring you.
Instead, I am doing my best to make your system two as effective as possible.
That is why my book [Digital Power](/book) is chock full of usable concepts.

But you need to turn your system two on to get results.
So I am trying to scare your system one into doing that.
