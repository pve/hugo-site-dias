title: 'Positions of Power in IT'
---
One of the aspirations of 'Digital Infrastructures at Scale' is to give you tools to influence the professional situation in which you find yourself.
A situation where your objective is to effect a certain transformation.

Two major examples of positions of power in IT are architects and auditors/assessors. 

An IT architect likes to create new stuff. Think of a new application that allows business users to work more effectively, for example a new customer relationship management (CRM) system. It is a piece of technology, but it will also be accompanied by new workflows and ways of working together, if it is to be succesful. It is a new technical and social reality in which new things are possible in an organisation. 
Other IT architects like to create, for example, digital infrastructures that will enable the faster deployment of such applications. 

While an IT architect is focussed on creating *positive* outcomes, an auditor or risk assessor is more concerned with avoiding *negative* outcomes. Every technology has risks, and without proper attention, these risks will prevent the positive outcomes from happening, or lead to other undesirable results, such as fines for non-compliance.

In both examples we can imagine that power plays a role. Without power, things will not move in the way you want. And any change initiative will result in counterpower and resistance. Understanding the sources of power and counterpower is essential for you to stand a chance of reaching your desirable outcomes. 

Money is a source of power, but it is a blunt instrument. And in an organiation there are other forces at work too. Often the survival of the organisation and its stakeholders is a more important source of power.
Linking survival and money together with precision is the key to realising the changes you are looking for.

This book aims to help you with that, through bringing you frameworks, insights, and examples.
