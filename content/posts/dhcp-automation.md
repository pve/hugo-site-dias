title: 'Dhcp Automation'
---
As we mature processes, they come within reach of actual automation. Especially IT management processes. To paraphrase General Charles de Gaulle, who said "War is the continuation of diplomacy with different means," we can say that automation is the continuation of process maturity with different means: namely computers instead of people.

I have two historically great examples of this. One of them is IP address allocation. In the past, whenever there was a new computer, you would walk up to the head of the lab or data center and ask for a new IP address for that machine. Remember that?

You'd go to the person in charge, who would pull out their notebook and write down the assigned IP address. This process took time and resources, but it worked.

I mean it's the paper napkin principle and uh so then in in 1994 for um well people were having some solutions for that but in 19 I remember that in 1994 I went to a Unix uh conference Unix systems manager conference and they had an American guy over and he was uh talking I had a presentation I forgot the presentation but we also talked about talked uh with him in the bar afterwards and he said that he talked about how the internet was built up of of of uh frame relay over and PLS over and it was a complete mess. 

Uh many many layers of technology to just push IP packets around which um I thought it was very genius back then but I think what he was trying to say was that how wasteful it really was. 

Anyway um he also said well you know um next year uh Microsoft's going to come out with a new version of Windows and you know which version I'm talking about and that has that has TCP P built in to the operating system and he said and he was associated with IETF or whatever. 

So at least with some standardization efforts and he said or with the telco and he said they're planning to sell 150,000 of those every month. 

Can you can you imagine how many IP addresses that will be right? Uh how are we going to manage these? 

They mentioned that Microsoft collaborated with others to define an automated system for IP address allocation, which we now know as DHCP. Around the same time, or possibly a bit earlier, a friend of mine, now a retired professor, was doing his PhD on network managementâ€”a concept that was quite elusive in the early 80s. What did network management entail? How would it be standardized? In 1982, the idea of computer networks was still new, and managing them seemed unnecessary because there were so few computers. However, once networks started to scale, network management became much more critical.

I likely have his PhD thesis somewhere. His research focused on SNMP and similar technologies, ultimately concluding that network management encompasses everything not yet automated into a protocol. This represents a maturity story: human management handles what we cannot automate. This model has been central to the development of IT and systems administration since the late 80s.
