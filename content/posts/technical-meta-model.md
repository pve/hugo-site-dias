title: 'Applying technology by following a system'
---

Applying technology follows certain rules. However, many people only have an intuitive understanding of these rules. As a result technology is not optimally applied. 
By understanding how applying technology really works, you can be more effective, more efficient, reduce waste, and overall do a better job. It takes just a few simple steps to improve any attempt at applying technology. We'll focus on information technology here, though most principles have wider applicability.

Let's start by looking at a few examples that I have used these in teaching IT students. The first example is fixing the WiFi at home, and the second one is selecting a new mobile phone for grandma. Think for a moment how you would approach these two cases. For a more corporate example you can think of replacing a content management system, or introducing a new security capability.

The core idea of technology is that by doing an intervention in the real world, you are achieving certain desirable outcomes. This is in contract to the core idea of science, which is that by doing observations on the real world, we can derive certain conclusions that allow us to predict what might happen under similar conditions in the future. Science seeks to understand and explain the underlying principles governing phenomena, while technology applies that understanding to create tools, systems, or processes that achieve specific goals.

Of course, science and technology are intertwined: technology relies on scientific insights to be more effective, while science often needs technology in order to do observations.
