This is the dawn of a new age.
I have been observing software development for more than fifty years, when I wrote my first computer program.
In that entire time, I have never witnessed a development that has changed the profession deeper, faster, or more pervasively than now.
AI-assisted coding has escaped from the lab, and is impacting the work of every software developer.

In the communities I track I hear stories of software engineers regretting to take a single week of vacation because of the innovations that they now have to catch up to.

I have lived through the revolutions of the Internet dot-com boom and cloud computing, but I feel this one is bigger.

Over the past weeks (May/June 2025) we have seen software development agents mature.
AI calls are now writing instructions for other AI calls. 


I shiver to think about the impact that this will have in hands of malicious actors, from script kiddies to nation-states.
