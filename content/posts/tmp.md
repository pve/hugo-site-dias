One of the key aspirations of Digital Infrastructures at Scale is to equip you with the tools to shape and drive change in your professional environment—especially when your goal is to lead a transformation.
Two key positions of influence in IT are architects and auditors/assessors.
IT architects are builders. They design new applications, platforms, and infrastructures that enable businesses to operate more effectively. A CRM system, for example, is not just a technical solution—it transforms workflows, communication, and decision-making. Similarly, infrastructure architects create digital foundations that accelerate the deployment of such applications.
Auditors and risk assessors, on the other hand, focus on preventing failure. Every technology introduces risks, and without proper attention, these risks can derail progress—whether through security breaches, compliance fines, or operational breakdowns.
Both roles involve power. Change does not happen in isolation, and every initiative encounters resistance. Understanding the sources of power—and the forces that push back—is essential for you to achieve meaningful outcomes.
Money is a form of power, but it is often a blunt instrument. In organizations, other forces—such as survival and strategic priorities—can be even more influential. The key to driving transformation is linking these forces together with precision.
This book provides you with the frameworks, insights, and real-world examples to navigate these challenges and drive successful change.
