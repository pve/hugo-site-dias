In the late 80s we were traveling with a group of friends in Tsavo East, a wild-life nature park in the south-east of Kenya, Africa.

This was a really remote area back then.
We drove for hours without seeing anyone, and had lunch in the middle of the road because there wasn't any traffic.

For miles around you only see bush, sand, and a few trees. It is a large savannah.

The road was uneven, and our friends did not have a 4-wheel drive.

So it happened that we had to cross a riverbed (a wadi) that had a lot of rocks in them, larger than we could comfortably drive the car over.

Turning back was no option, nor was waiting for help.

The only solution was to lift the car and put stones under the wheels to allow it to cross larger boulders.

For that we used the simplest, and probably most ancient piece of technology: the lever.
Archimedes already said, "Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world,"

In the bush we found a 3 meter pole, which we levered on a rock, and used to lift the car where we wanted it.

The lift was quite easy, as a little calculation shows.
We needed to lift about half the weight of the car, let's say 400 kilogram, with a 1:10 lever.
That requires a downward force of 40 kilograms, which you can get by just leaning in your bodyweight.

That is the essence of technology.
Creating constructs out of material that help apply force in a designed, intentional, and purposeful way.

It took us about an hour to cross the riverbed, but the memory of that experience has lasted a lifetime.

Ingenuity and the use of materials at hand had gotten us out of a difficult situation.

It looks like a big leap from that situation to artificial intelligence, but the principles remain the same.
Artificial intelligence is the newest technology that we apply to a data processing task.
