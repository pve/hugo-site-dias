<p>MCP, Model Context Protocol, was introduced in November 2024 as a standardised way to feed AI chatbots with extra information.
You can extend Claude or OpenAI desktop with MCP servers, which are basically small programs that run on the desktop and have access to all information and services that the user has.</p>

For example, an MCP could access sensitive corporate documents on the local network, and send them to an AI model, even if that is running on another continent.</p>
<p>Most MCP servers I have seen are written in node.js, which requires npm to be installed, which is not exactly known for its great security track record, see <a href="https://www.criticalstart.com/securing-the-ecosystem-navigating-the-risks-of-npm-packages-in-modern-software-development/">here</a> and <a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/securing-the-cloud/review-of-recent-npm-based-vulnerabilities/">here</a>.</p>
