      <description>&lt;p&gt;How does vibe coding work in the real? Vibe coding is having AI write your software. Coined by Andrej Karpathy, the hype is all over the map, with companies that are rethinking their hiring strategies for programmers. Sounds like disaster for software engineers and programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious, I reached out to an old friend who is an experienced software engineer. He was a co-founder in a SaaS company in the monitoring space. After a successful exit he now has a bit more time to pursue hobbies. But he is still professionally busy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Big tech afhankelijkheid: wat is het echte risico?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/autonomie-van-bigtech/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Het nationale sentiment is negatief over de afhankelijkheid van &amp;lsquo;big tech&amp;rsquo;. Overheidsdata staat in een Amerikaanse cloud, we hebben geen eigen sociaal netwerk, enzovoort. En vergelijkbare sentimenten spelen bij andere organisaties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emoties zijn vaak een goede indicator, maar geen goede inhoudelijke analyse.
Ze leiden daarom nog wel eens tot beslissingen die onhandig, of zelfs contraproductief uitpakken. Hier legt de emotie wantrouwen bloot, maar waar die zich op richt moet een analyse uitwijzen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Network Management Automation - DHCP</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/dhcp-automation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we mature processes, they come within reach of actual automation. Especially IT management processes. To paraphrase General Carl von Clausewitz, who said &amp;ldquo;War is the continuation of diplomacy with different means&amp;rdquo;, we can say that automation is the progression of process maturity with different means - replacing human effort with software and systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite historical example is IP address allocation. In the past, whenever there was a new computer, you would walk up to the head of the lab or data center and ask for a new IP address for that machine. You may remember that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>5 Elements of Cloud Security</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/5-elements-of-cloud-security/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;five-elements-of-cloud-security&#34;&gt;Five elements of cloud security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, IT security started with &lt;strong&gt;infrastructure security&lt;/strong&gt;. Just protecting the data center was good enough. But that was before we had data communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When data started to escape the confines of the data center we needed to protect it. Typically through encryption. Hence we need &lt;strong&gt;data security&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the world wide web developed, we saw applications being exposed to it, and frankly, be vulnerable. So that is when &lt;strong&gt;application security&lt;/strong&gt; started to become more important.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How AI Can Help IT Risk Classification</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-risk-classification/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-risk-classification/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How cool would it be to let an AI do some of the grunt work in analysing the risk of applications and services. This has the potential to speed up the work of risk assessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, does it work in practice? Well, here is an example of AI-assisted risk classification. I downloaded some of the entries in the Dutch &lt;a href=&#34;https://algoritmes.overheid.nl/en&#34;&gt;algorithm register&lt;/a&gt;, which is a public register of systems that use algorithms. For each entry about 30 fields are available, including name, classification, owner, et cetera.
Some of the systems in the registry are AI-based. Indeed, we have AI to help check on AI&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Applying technology follows a pattern</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/technical-meta-model/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How to fix the WiFi? How to find a new phone for grandma?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying technology follows certain rules. However, many people only have an intuitive understanding of these rules. As a result technology is not optimally applied.
By understanding how applying technology really works, you can be more effective, more efficient, reduce waste, and overall do a better job. It takes just a few simple steps to improve any attempt at applying technology. We&amp;rsquo;ll focus on information technology here, though most principles have wider applicability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>International Actors</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The international arena has many actors that can influence digital infrastructures. But opinions differ on what the important ones are, or even what the relevant ones are.
By the nature of scaling, very few digital infrastructures are influenced by national actors only. The international arena is complex, and there are even conflicting views on how it is made up.
These conflicting views can best be seen as maps of the territory. And as I have mentioned earlier, a map is only relevant for a specific purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The US Air Force Zero Trust Strategy</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/airforce-zero-trust-strategy/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 12:26:58 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/airforce-zero-trust-strategy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who is really doing Zero Trust?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the US Air Force is. Here is my summary, with some comments, of their strategy document for the benefit of my Certificate of Competence in Zero Trust (CCZT) learners. In fact, this is an edited version of a conversation we had during one of our classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the full strategy &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dafcio.af.mil/Portals/64/Documents/Strategy/DAF%20API%20Reference%20Architecture%202.0.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the current roadmap &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dafcio.af.mil/Portals/64/Documents/Strategy/DAF%20Enterprise%20Zero%20Trust%20Roadmap%20and%20Release%20Notes_v2.0.pdf?ver=36cbAKNEe7JiRVAPFwWepg%3d%3d&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, all linked from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dafcio.af.mil/&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the fundamental first important point about the strategy document is that it exists at all. There is an actual organization of significant size that has a strategy and is implementing it. Many can learn from this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In the Netherlands, we are currently engaged in a heated debate about the undesirable dominance of big tech, particularly over a significant portion of the digital infrastructure of the Dutch government. This includes email, file storage, and many other forms of digital storage and processing—most of which are handled by American big tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure a similar debate is going on in many other countries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Deployment diagrams for network security; fix this</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/network-diagram-fix/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 17:09:20 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/network-diagram-fix/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while back, I introduced my take on deployment diagrams for cloud and devops infrastructure. Some of the big points there are: it starts with intuitive drawings. Many people draw these things in similar ways, even without them having formal training.
In fact, formal training in architecture diagrams will not necessarily make those drawings easier to understand for the uninitiated.
But still. There are good drawings and there are drawings that can be improved.
My other big point is that deployment diagrams can be a great tool for security analysis. I am in some conversations with friends at banks who use them.
Recently I ran into the following example. Here is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://syang.substack.com/p/security-group-and-network-acl-in&#34;&gt;explanation of the difference between VPC and security groups&lt;/a&gt;. Great story, but I have some comments on the diagram, which used to come &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Security.html&#34;&gt;from AWS itself&lt;/a&gt;, by the way, but has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Top 8 cloud risks according to ENISA</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/top-8-cloud-risks-according-to-enisa/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2015 09:22:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/top-8-cloud-risks-according-to-enisa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Does security in the cloud ever bother you? It would be weird if it didn’t. Cloud computing has a lot of benefits, but also a lot of risks if done in the wrong way.
So what are the most important risks? The European Network Information Security Agency did extensive research on that in 2009 already, and identified 35 risk categories. This analysis is used by a number of players in the industry, including certain banking regulators. From those 35, ENISA has selected 8 as the most relevant ones. This article explains them, not in any particular order. (And by the way: ENISA is pronounced as ‘eniesa’, not ‘enaiza’).
You can also get the story on my YouTube video.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Directories are also infrastructures</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/directories-are-also-infrastructures/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2006 10:54:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/directories-are-also-infrastructures/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the big projects I am working on right now (2006) is directory services for identity management. In these directories digital identities such as loginnames, addresses, access rights, etc. are stored. With an adequately structured directory service, the proper management of access rights becomes a lot easier, which translates into cost savings and better security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of these include the internet&amp;rsquo;s Domain Name System (DNS) and Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Active Directory. A lot of organizations however, have requirements beyond these systems, and for these a wide range of custom solutions are used.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Network Neutrality: who pays the ferryman?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/network-neutrality-who-pays-the-ferryman/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2006 13:54:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/network-neutrality-who-pays-the-ferryman/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Network neutrality has become the topic of intense discussion and legislative action.&lt;br&gt;
See the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/21/AR2006012100094.html&#34;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; , a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality&#34;&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.circleid.com/posts/network_neutrality/&#34;&gt;CircelID&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the issue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand people argue for &amp;lsquo;universal service&amp;rsquo; that say that one person&amp;rsquo;s bits should not be treated differently from another person&amp;rsquo;s. This compares to the idea that the phone company should not be allowed to treat your calls differently depending on what you want to say, or that red haired people would have a different monthly fee. There are laws against this type of discrimination (at least in most nations), and some people want to extend this law to Internet traffic. On the other hand there are some Internet providers who want to charge different customers different rates for different service. &amp;ldquo;We can&amp;rsquo;t have companies freeloading on our expensive pipes&amp;rdquo;, they claim.
Clearly we seem to want both. We don&amp;rsquo;t want the phone companies to decide which traffic gets carried, and we also don’t want a bland one-size-fits-all service that is expensive for some and inadequate for others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
