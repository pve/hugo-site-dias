<title>Great Introduction to Zero Trust | Digital Infrastructures at Scale</title>
<meta name="keywords" content="">
<meta name="description" content="“Project Zero Trust” is a business novel by George Finney. It talks about an emerging approach to IT and Cybersecurity that attempts to reduce cyberrisk in a more fundamental way.
Zero Trust is a bit of a hype in IT these days, and both product companies and knowledge agencies are dropping lots of papers on this. But this book is in another game.
What I like about it is that it paints a reasonably realistic picture of a modern enterprise, including the information technology choices that it makes. This serves as a good backdrop to a variety of Zero Trust initiatives, which are described in a bit of detail.
As an instructor I find that most of the vendor neutral training material out there lacks specific examples. This makes it hard for students to anchor the abstract concepts that they are fed to a realistic environment with some resemblance to their job situation.">
