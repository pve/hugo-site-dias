Can the client ISP charge the ISP of a specific server? I.e. can AOL charge Yahoo and not Google, for providing the bandwidth for videos? This would seem odd, as the entire service of hooking up Yahoo and Google is already provided by the transit provider. At the same time, AOL can charge the home customer more for higher speed service. The same holds for the provider of the hosting company.

See the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/21/AR2006012100094.html">Washington Post</a> , a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality">Wikipedia article</a>, and <a href="http://www.circleid.com/posts/network_neutrality/">CircelID</a>.</p>
<p>What is the issue?</p>
<p>On the one hand people argue for &lsquo;universal service&rsquo; that say that one person&rsquo;s bits should not be treated differently from another person&rsquo;s.
This compares to the idea that the phone company should not be allowed to treat your calls differently depending on what you want to say, or that red haired people would have a different monthly fee.
There are laws against this type of discrimination (at least in most nations), and some people want to extend this law to Internet traffic.
On the other hand there are some Internet providers who want to charge different customers different rates for different service. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t have companies freeloading on our expensive pipes&rdquo;, they claim.
Clearly we seem to want both.
We don&rsquo;t want the phone companies to decide which traffic gets carried, and we also don’t want a bland one-size-fits-all service that is expensive for some and inadequate for others.</p>
<p>My idea is that the issue is a bit oversimplified, and will become more clear if we use the right model of who connects to whom, as well as who pays who. This model recognizes three types of players, instead of one or two as we were used to.
