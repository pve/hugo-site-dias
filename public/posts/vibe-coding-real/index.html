Understand that this is quite opinionated, but it does match my own experiences.\nFirst of all, don’t rely on Co-pilot and other assistants.

If relevant, he asks for more explanation of alternatives. Claude still has a tendency to generate code, but you should include ’no code’ in the prompt a few times.

If not, his approach is to use OpenAI Deep Research to create a markdown file with all the relevant documentation on the specific library he is using. The idea is to not pollute the Claude history with irrelevant information on the libraries. This then goes into the Claude Project. One of the nice things is that you can then also ‘chat’ with the documentation.\nSometimes the chat with Claude becomes too long, and a warning is issued. The approach then is to ask Claude for a summary of the chat, and use that as the beginning of a new chat.\nFor debugging there is the Claude Code command line, which can look directly at files in the code directory. This has faster feedback than going back to the github repository.\nIn summary, if you know what you are doing and apply some structure, using AI to support you in software construction has a lot of potential to increase productivity.\n",
