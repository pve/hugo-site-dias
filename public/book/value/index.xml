      <title>Value in Process Improvement</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most digital infrastructures are meant to communicate or coordinate, or are in support of other digital infrastructures that communicate or coordinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet is a prime example. It is designed to enable computers to communicate by moving data packets between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media is another example, used by people to communicate with each other. Its success is a testament to the fact that communication is a fundamental human need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an example of a supporting digital infrastructure you can look at an IaaS provider, which enables data processing and storage for other applications and infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Provider Value</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The sheer separation of the providers from the consumers of these infrastructures drives a lot of the value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine stringing a wire to connect your PC to your neighbour&amp;rsquo;s PC in order to play a game together. People have been doing these things. How long does that take? What is the cost? Where do you buy the cable? How are you going to run that cable? It is a lot faster to just use the internet for that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Multiple Ways to Go Cloud</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/value/three-ways-to-go-cloud/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Public cloud migrations come in different shapes and sizes, but I see three major approaches. Each of these has very different technical and governance implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;three-approaches&#34;&gt;Three approaches&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies dying to get rid of their data centers often get started on a &lt;strong&gt;‘lift and shift’&lt;/strong&gt; approach, where applications are moved from existing servers to equivalent servers in the cloud. The cloud service model consumed here is mainly IaaS (infrastructure as a service). Not much is outsourced to cloud providers here. Contrast that with SaaS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
