<p>Most digital infrastructures are meant to communicate or coordinate, or are in support of other digital infrastructures that communicate or coordinate.
That is where their prime value is.</p>
<p>The internet is a great example. It is designed to enable computers to communicate by moving data packets between them.</p>
<p>Social media is another example, used by people to communicate with each other. Its success is a testament to the fact that communication is a fundamental human need.</p>
<p>For an example of a supporting digital infrastructure you can look at an IaaS provider, which enables data processing and storage for other applications and infrastructures.</p>
<p>From a business perspective this communication and coordination can lead to value in the form of, amongst others:</p>
<ol>
<li>better resource utilization and less waste,</li>
<li>better process efficiency,</li>
<li>better quality of services and products,</li>
<li>reduction of risks.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just the major, broad categories of delivering value, and there is considerable overlap between them. For example an organization&rsquo;s website helps communicate to its customers. But you can also look at it as a more efficient way to organise the coordination on the delivery of products and services to the customer.</p>
<p>As you dive deeper into business processes, you will find that there is a wide range of processes and ways that lead to business value, each of which has its own peculiar ways of communicating and coordinating. In the early days of networking, I was sometimes asked what the value of a network is.
That is a hard questions.
Equally unanswerable is the question what the value of a message is. It just depends on the role that such a message plays in a process. For example, if your house is on fire, you only need a small message to reach the fire department, but if it does not get there, you&rsquo;ll lose a house.</p>
<p>Strategy consulting firms, like the one I worked at, do a lot of work in process reengineering to create value for their clients. The larger firms have serious collections of proces improvements. Over the past decades, significant reengineering of supply chains has taken place. The core idea of that is typically that better coordination reduces risk and inefficiencies.</p>
<p>I think that just about any process can be improved with more information and communication.
The questions remain: at what cost, which stakeholders will benefit, and which stakeholders will experience negative results.</p>
<hr>
<p>What is information really?
If we know that, we can try to understand how we can judge its value, or even start to understand how we can create value with information.</p>
<p>In Claude Shannon&rsquo;s theory of communication, information is about reducing uncertainty.
Another way is to say that more information means less noise because if you add noise to information, that information will have more uncertainty and less value.</p>
<p>To visualize this, think of a picture that is obscured by a bit of fog or haze.
You can still see some of the picture, but not very clearly.
You will make more errors when trying to understand what the picture means.</p>
<p>Similarly, think of the difference between a grainy low resolution image, where you can see the individual pixels, versus a high resolution version of that image.
More pixels, more bits, less uncertainty.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/deploy-images/shannonresolution.png"></p>
<p>It is the same with sound.
Being in the hall with musicians gives you much more opportunity to hear all instruments and singers compared to listening to it over the phone.</p>
<h3 id="future-value">Future value<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#future-value">#</a></h3>
<p>Value can come from the reduction of uncertainty.
If you know that a storm is coming, you can take protective measures and reduce damage.
If you know a storm is <em>not</em> coming, you can enjoy a day outside.
If you know neither, you cannot take advantage of the weather.</p>
<p>In business, the more you know about the potential customer, the more likely you can make them an offer that they will be interested in.</p>
<p>In information security, if you know about potential vulnerabilities, you can make it less likely to suffer damage from them.</p>
<p>An example from service management. Suppose your digital infrastructure is down a day a year, on the average.
Your consumers will suffer from that, because it reduces their potential to benefit.
How are you going to make it better, with less downtime?
Now suppose you know that this happens on particular days, or hours, or with specific customers.
With that information you can make more targeted investments in improving your digital infrastructure, which now are more likely to have a positive return on investment.</p>
<p>The pattern that we see here is that information on the current state of affairs allows us to influence the <em>future</em> outcome of a process, and with that, we can create value.</p>
<p>One of the most dramatic examples of that in the history of computing is the breaking of the Enigma code in World War II, by Alan Turing and his team members.
This allowed the allies to reduce the loss that german U-boats were inflicting on transatlantic supply ships.</p>
<h3 id="information-processing-is-information-reduction">Information processing is information reduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#information-processing-is-information-reduction">#</a></h3>
<p>Paradoxically, we never really seem to <em>generate</em> really new information, only more relevant information.
We can call something information processing, but in reality we are only <em>reducing</em> information.
If we compute the sum of two numbers, we are left with the sum, but that is not new information.
It was, in a way, already there.
And if we don&rsquo;t show where the result came from (the two numbers) we are left with <em>less</em> information.</p>
<p>If in a table of inventory, we update the inventory with the result of many transactions, the resulting inventory table does not have more information than before.
Of course, the information is more relevant to the current state.</p>
<p>But, what about generative AI, you may ask.
Isn&rsquo;t that generating information?
With only a small prompt, we can have the AI generate a complete research report, or term paper, or nice new image.
Yes, it looks like that, but the inference engine that takes your prompt, <em>also</em> takes in a huge model and combines the two into a new artefact, which is a lot smaller than your prompt and the model together.
And in fact, the model itself is the result of processing huge amounts of training data.</p>
<p>But, the information that is the result of this reduction can be more valuable.
Less is more.
Paradoxical, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Automation is a big part of IT, but not all automation brings value.
Automation takes time and effort, upfront, and any benefits come later.</p>
<p>Think of the IT projects you were involved in, most of those aimed at providing a measurable benefit somewhere.</p>
<p>This diagram (from xkcd, a series of webcomics) illustrates when automating repetitive tasks, or even just parts of them, brings benefit.
In other words, is there a <em>business case</em> for such an intervention?</p>
<p><img alt="xkcd 1205" loading="lazy" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/is_it_worth_the_time.png"></p>
<p>The objective of this diagram is to show how much time you can invest in automating tasks.
You can think of tasks such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>reducing 3 clicks off a digital workflow</li>
<li>converting a spreadsheet to another data format</li>
<li>scheduling an appointment</li>
<li>looking up some research</li>
<li>running a test</li>
<li>installing a new version of a piece of software</li>
<li>saving a piece of evidence for an audit</li>
<li>setting up an auto reply rule in a mailbox</li>
</ul>
<p>Such manual tasks can be shortened or eliminated with a bit more automation.
The top row of the diagram indicates how often that task is done.
The left column shows how much time the automation would save, per individual execution of the task.</p>
<p>Each cell in the table then shows the amount of effort that you can spend on that automation and still have a net positive outcome over five years.
The table contains a number of black (empty) cells.
My understanding is that these are &lsquo;impossible&rsquo; situations.
For example, you cannot execute a one-hour task fifty times a day, according to this table.
This is only true, in my opinion, if you assume a single person is doing that task.
If a whole team can benefit from the automation, there would be useful numbers in those cells as well.</p>
<p>Each cell shows what investment would have a five-year <em>break-even point</em>, as it is called, that is: if you spend this amount of time on it, the break-even point will be five years.
If only half the investment is necessary, the break-even point will be two-and-a-half years.
If only a tenth of the investment is necessary, the break-even point will be six months.</p>
<p>For example, if I can reduce the time it takes to do a daily task by one minute, two hours of investment in that will be paid back in about six months.</p>
<p>Of course this is a simple way of looking at those business cases.
This does not take into account other costs or benefits.
A couple of examples of that:</p>
<ul>
<li>computer usage is not included as a cost</li>
<li>maintenance over the five year period is not included</li>
<li>the use case you are automating could change drastically in five years, making your automation obsolete</li>
<li>automation often leads to more consistent quality, especially as you use it more often, a great example of that is in automated testing</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this uncertainty favors focusing on automating tasks where the benefit substantially outweighs the cost.</p>
<hr>
<p>Consumers of digital infrastructures benefit from not running them themselves, but having a provider who serves more consumers do it for them.</p>
<p>Imagine stringing a wire to connect your PC to your neighbor&rsquo;s PC in order to play a game together. People have been doing these things. How long does it take to string the wires and connect them? What is the cost? Where do you buy the cable? How are you going to run that cable? It is a lot faster to just use the internet for that.</p>
<p>The introduction of a separate provider changes the provisioning process. For one thing, the provisioning can go much faster. The provider has capacity (stock so to say) that can just be used. Related to that is that the service is already defined by the provider. Instead of designing it from scratch, you just pick one of the options offered. Presumably, that option has had a lot of design and thinking behind it already. It is likely to be a better option than anything that you can think of yourself.</p>
<p>So, that brings value: it can be faster and better than your homegrown alternatives.</p>
<p>Because the provider has multiple consumers, there are economies of scale that play out. Whole books have been written on this, and we will be looking into that in more detail. Think of sharing of unused capacity. Not everybody is using their internet link to the max all the time.</p>
<p>But &lsquo;digital&rsquo; brings more specific benefits. It is the opportunity to automate service delivery that has immense effects on economies of scale. Think about it: if a piece of software does its work, replicating that piece of software across a lot of servers is a negligible amount of effort in comparison to creating that software, typically. In contrast, baking 1000 pizzas is a lot more work than just baking one or two.</p>
<p>Finally, consumers can find value in being connected with other consumers. There is transactional value in that, to arrange or discuss matters, but for most people there is emotional value in being connected to other people.
The value of a phone or social network to the individual users, not just the network owner, increases with the number of other users connected to it. As a result the value of the network increases quadratically with the number of users. This has implications for the power balance, as we will discuss later.</p>
<p>In a later unit we&rsquo;ll discuss some of the words that economists use for these phenomena, such as investment externalities and network externalities.</p>
<hr>
<p>Getting to value quickly has value in itself.
The faster you get to value, the better it is, generally.
We&rsquo;ll discuss some of the reasons for that elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Agile development</strong> is all the fashion nowadays for getting to digital value quickly.
Why is that and what kind of digital infrastructures does that require?
Back in the old days, business software was primarily written to automate <strong><em>existing</em></strong> business processes. Those processes might change somewhat as a result, but in the core processes were no different. Think accounting systems, scheduling, &ldquo;customer relationship management&rdquo; and so on.</p>
<p>Today we see that software not only automates these business processes, but becomes part of the product, or even becomes the product itself. And on top of that, this software is often an on-line service. Think of the smart room thermostat.
Or financial services, where software increasingly is the main part of the product: think online banking. And in social media from Facebook to Tindr, software really is the product.</p>
<h2 id="the-development-dance">The development dance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-development-dance">#</a></h2>
<p>Every product changes the world that uses it. Think how cars have changed the way people commute, or even choose where they live. Software is no different. But a changing world also changes the products we can use or want to use. There is a kind of dance between supply and demand. Do we have breakfast out of our house more often because there are more opportunities for this or does the supply of breakfast places increase as a result of us going out more? Just as in a dance, it is not always easy to tell who is leading who.</p>
<p>Because software now has become the product it will also participate in the dance, and then it becomes more important to quickly adapt to the dance partner. As a developer, you change the world that uses your software in ways you cannot always predict, so in reaction you have to adapt to that world.</p>
<p>The faster the better.</p>
<p>This explains the need for agile development. Between idea and realization (time to market) there should not be two years, but only two weeks, and preferably less.</p>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-digital-infrastructures-does-that-require">What kind of digital infrastructures does that require?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-kind-of-digital-infrastructures-does-that-require">#</a></h2>
<p>The prime objective of digital infrastructures is to enable the deployment of application functionality. The quality of digital infrastructures used to be measured in the number of users it could support well. I.e. we used to talk about a system supporting 10.000 concurrent users with less than 4 seconds response time.</p>
<p>But agile development comes with a new goal: &lsquo;feature velocity‚Äô. That is the speed with which new features can be deployed. The time between inception of a feature and its deployment to a large user base has to be shorter than the time it takes for the environment to change. In a dance you want to anticipate your partner, not stand on their toes.</p>
<p>Your digital infrastructure should not be a bottleneck. This requires features such as automated testing, quick scaling up and down of resources, and as little manual intervention as possible. This is the only way to shorten the lead time for a change.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-computing">Cloud computing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cloud-computing">#</a></h2>
<p>In summary: agile development requires cloud computing. Remember: the essential characteristics of cloud computing include fast, elastic and self-service provisioning of resources. That is what is required for agile development.</p>
<p>And then the dance continues. Because if we can do that, we can do other new things. Like better security. If you can respond quicker to new functional requirements, you can also respond quicker to security issues.</p>

<h3 id="business-model-canvas">Business Model Canvas<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#business-model-canvas">#</a></h3>
<p>The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management tool that serves as a visual framework for developing and discussing business models.
For additional information, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas</a>.</p>
<p>The business model canvas has nine basic building blocks. These define the interconnections and relationships within a business model.</p>
<p>The example used in this section is Amazon Web Services (AWS), particularly EC2 (virtual machines on demand). This is an Infrastructure as a Service offering. The power of the business model canvas approach becomes clear when we see how it can distinguish between various cloud service offerings.

<h3 id="customer-segments-cs">Customer Segments (CS)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#customer-segments-cs">#</a></h3>
<p>Customer segments are the groups of customers that the company ultimately serves, i.e., the ones that consume and pay for the services.</p>
<p>In the AWS case, although practically anybody with a credit card can spin up a virtual machine, in 2015, Amazon primarily targeted software developers and (startup) SaaS providers as the main customers. Historically, the Amazon development teams were the first customers, and external customers were initially added as an afterthought.</p>
<h3 id="value-propositions-vp">Value Propositions (VP)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#value-propositions-vp">#</a></h3>
<p>Value propositions reflect customer problems and needs. This central element describes why the customer would ultimately pay for the product or service.</p>
<p>The value proposition of a cloud computing service is driven by its five essential characteristics. For example, in the AWS EC2 case, the core component of the value proposition is rapid self-service provisioning of virtual machines with pay-per-use billing. For each individual customer, these translate into different business advantages, like fast provisioning, reduced capital expenditure, and minimized risk of over-investing.</p>
<h3 id="channels-ch">Channels (CH)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#channels-ch">#</a></h3>
<p>Value propositions are delivered to customers through communication, distribution, and sales channels.</p>
<p>It is often assumed that cloud computing relies solely on self-service direct sales, but the reality is much more diverse. SaaS providers, in particular, are developing extensive partner programs. AWS primarily employed a self-service direct model, where delivery is through APIs. The model is enhanced by premium support.</p>
<h3 id="customer-relationships-cr">Customer Relationships (CR)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#customer-relationships-cr">#</a></h3>
<p>Customer relations are established and maintained with each specific customer segment.</p>
<p>One way AWS maintains relationships with its customer segments is through conferences. The 2013 re:Invent developer conference attracted 9,000 visitors.
In 2024, the conference, no longer solely focused on developers, drew around 60,000 visitors.
Additionally, there are vibrant online communities.
AWS has shifted its customer relationships significantly since 2013, targeting new customer segments, and consequently, new relationship channels.</p>
<h3 id="revenue-streams-rs">Revenue Streams (RS)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#revenue-streams-rs">#</a></h3>
<p>Revenue streams result from value propositions that are successfully offered to customers.</p>
<p>The structure of revenue streams is where cloud computing differs from earlier IT service models, as they are usage-based rather than asset-based. AWS charges hourly fees per virtual machine; the bigger the virtual machine, the higher the hourly rate.</p>
<h3 id="key-resources-kr">Key Resources (KR)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-resources-kr">#</a></h3>
<p>Key resources are the assets required to offer and deliver the previously mentioned elements (e.g., value proposition, customer relationships).</p>
<p>AWS owns massive amounts of hardware, estimated at 1 million servers or more in 2015, housed in dozens of data centers worldwide. But there is more. The service can only be delivered through advanced and unique fulfillment software and processes.</p>
<h3 id="key-activities-ka">Key Activities (KA)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-activities-ka">#</a></h3>
<p>At AWS the key activity, delivery, is highly automated. But at the AWS scale, oversight and resource
planning is still a significant effort. Optimizing assets versus utilization is very essential in the IaaS
business model. Through economies of scale, AWS is able to spend a lot of effort on these activities.</p>
<h3 id="key-partnerships-kp">Key Partnerships (KP)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-partnerships-kp">#</a></h3>
<p>Some activities are outsourced, and some resources are acquired outside the enterprise.</p>
<p>AWS buys immense amounts of hardware, and uses a lot of (open source) software. Building out data
centers is also likely to be outsourced.</p>
<h3 id="cost-structure-cs">Cost Structure (CS)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cost-structure-cs">#</a></h3>
<p>All business model elements discussed above impact the cost structure.</p>
<p>In more traditional IT service models the revenue streams are tightly coupled to the cost structure. The
cloud computing innovation is also about decoupling these.
At AWS, the main cost elements are in assets such as servers and data centers, in services such as
electrical power and telecommunications, and in people for managing the systems.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#summary">#</a></h3>
<p>The business model canvas is a useful tool to map out the particulars of cloud provider business models. In this section, we have only looked at the basics of a particular infrastructure provider.
It is also useful for software-as-a-service providers as we will see in the next unit.
It can also be used to expand on the business model of internal/private cloud providers.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here is a high-level overview of the SaaS provider business model and some of the strategic options that are in there.</p>
<h3 id="business-model-canvas-1">Business Model Canvas<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#business-model-canvas-1">#</a></h3>
<p>In this unit, we&rsquo;ll explore examples using two hypothetical SaaS providers: one offering bookkeeping software and the other a project collaboration platform.</p>
<p><img alt="SaaS Cloud Canvas" loading="lazy" src="BusinessCanvasSaaS.png"></p>
<h3 id="customer-segments-cs-1">Customer segments (CS)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#customer-segments-cs-1">#</a></h3>
<p>In the Business Model Canvas, ‚ÄúCustomer Segments‚Äù are the groups of customers that the company ultimately serves, I.e. the ones that consume and pay for the services.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of the SaaS model that this could basically be anybody, not just IT people. Let us just remind ourselves that customers here are the ones that use the service to get their business done, or get their personal lives in order. In a business context we often also have to distinguish between the user and the organization that purchases the solution. This is very likely true in the case of our bookkeeping software company.</p>
<h3 id="value-propositions-vp-1">Value Propositions (VP)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#value-propositions-vp-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Value propositions reflect the customer problems and needs. This is the central element that describes why the customer would ultimately pay for the product or service.</p>
<p>The essential characteristics of cloud computing may or may not relate directly to the core value proposition of the software application. In our first example, the core value proposition ‚Äîautomated bookkeeping‚Äî is unrelated to cloud computing. Of course, cloud computing‚Äôs characteristics give the SaaS proposition an edge above its direct on-premises alternatives even if the functionality would be the same. Self-service provisioning leads to quicker time to deploy, more scalability in usage (whether accounts or transactions), lower investments or commitments, and potentially lower cost.
The value proposition is fundamentally different in the second example, the project collaboration support site. In this example, the cloud&rsquo;s characteristic of broad network accessibility directly enhances the software&rsquo;s usefulness for users spanning company boundaries.
Interestingly, the first provider could use this insight to extend its functionality beyond what would be possible in an on-premises solution. Think collaboration with accountants, suppliers and possibly customers, or channel partners.</p>
<h3 id="channels-ch-1">Channels (CH)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#channels-ch-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Value propositions are delivered to customers through communications, distribution and sales channels.</p>
<p>It is often assumed that cloud computing relies solely on self-service direct sales, but the reality is much more diverse. SaaS providers in particular are developing extensive partner programs.
The typical enterprise software solution is not implemented overnight. It takes attention to change management and alignment on master data for example. That is why system integrators often experience the move from on-premises to SaaS as relatively painless. They are doing the same job on a different environment.
Less invasive SaaS offerings are frequently aggregated in broker portals, commonly referred to as &rsquo;enterprise app stores.&rsquo; These portals add value through consolidated billing, self-service provisioning, identity management, and potentially some data integration. But that is one to paint on another business model canvas.</p>
<p>Another natural extension of the SaaS model is exposing the core functionality through an API. While not often directly accessed by the consumer, this does allow integration with other SaaS providers. Our project collaboration software could integrate with an existing cloud storage provider.
The main SaaS channels therefore are direct self-service sales, value added re-sellers, system integrators, and enterprise app-stores. The notion of cloud broker fits in here as well, but dissecting its many shapes and forms is a topic beyond the scope of this section.</p>
<h3 id="customer-relationships-cr-1">Customer Relationships (CR)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#customer-relationships-cr-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Customer relations are established and maintained with each specific customer segment.</p>
<p>The lure of cloud computing is that the provider can have a much more direct relation with the customer than is possible with an on-premises solution. Technically, the provider can potentially see each and every move from the users. Which software builder would not like to be able to see the popularity of every feature in real-time? This allows for much more rapid innovation cycles.</p>
<p>It is not impossible for the loop from idea to wide customer feedback to be closed in a couple of hours.
However, this power can bring the provider in conflict with the consumer who might object to its data being used. As an example that is close to the limit of what might be considered acceptable consider the following case.
An on-line bookkeeping service for individuals allows them to categorize payments to merchants. Once enough individuals categorized Danny‚Äôs steakhouse as a restaurant, this can then also be suggested to other clients of Danny‚Äôs. Is it legal to use data from one cloud consumer to deliver value to another? Generally speaking, the answer is no, but it may be acceptable if only aggregate data is used.
Support is often easier on-line, and on-line communities often add considerable value for the consumer.</p>
<h3 id="revenue-streams-rs-1">Revenue Streams (RS)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#revenue-streams-rs-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Revenue streams are the result of value propositions that are successfully offered to customers.</p>
<p>The structure of revenue streams is where cloud computing differs from earlier IT service models. Software firms traditionally relied on licensing arrangements that were somewhat usage based, and could be hard to enforce technically as well as legally.</p>
<p>Cloud computing service models by definition are usage based, and have the potential to be much more closely related to the value that is experienced by the customers. Both our examples enhance the productivity of users, and it is natural to charge per user who has access to the functionality on daily basis. Transactional services such as event management or email delivery are more naturally charged by the transaction, potentially on a bulk basis.</p>
<h3 id="key-resources-kr-1">Key Resources (KR)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-resources-kr-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Key resources are the assets required to offer and deliver the previously mentioned elements (e.g. value proposition, customer relationships).</p>
<p>The core asset of a software company is likely to be its code base, its understanding of consumer requirements and processes, and the staff that does this. For a SaaS provider, this is augmented with actual technical service delivery and understanding of consumer behavior.</p>
<p>It may seem a small matter to go from knowing your software and the way it runs at your customer‚Äôs sites to running the software yourself. Yet, the competencies involved are fairly different.
The most obvious differences between cloud providers and software delivery companies are in multi-tenancy and feature velocity. Every SaaS provider has to think about how multi-tenant his software needs to be to realize the right scalability model for its customers. Feature velocity, the time between inception and go-live is a great competitive differentiator. To achieve this, the provider requires an integrated &lsquo;DevOps&rsquo; organization, demanding significant input from people, processes, and technology.
Then, on the physical asset side, an important question is how much delivery assets the company decided to have. Does it need to own hardware assets or are they sourced from an upstream cloud provider? On the canvas, this represents a trade-off between resource and partnerships.</p>
<h3 id="key-activities-ka-1">Key Activities (KA)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-activities-ka-1">#</a></h3>
<p>The key resources perform key activities.</p>
<p>The obvious key activity at a software company is: develop software. In the long run, these should increase the value of the code base. For a SaaS cloud provider, actually delivering the software as a service is an extension to that. The virtuous circle in a SaaS provider is understanding customer behavior and requirements, translating these into new functionality and delivering this to customers.
For this to be successful on the SaaS scale, it has to be executed as an integrated pipeline. The most advanced organizations get the operational activities out of the way. Developers and product managers are empowered to push features to production. Tests are all automated and the focus of operational staff is not so much into bringing features in production, but to maintain the assets and operational fabric that allow the developers to do that themselves.</p>
<h3 id="key-partnerships-kp-1">Key Partnerships (KP)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-partnerships-kp-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Some activities are outsourced, and some resources are acquired outside the enterprise.</p>
<p>A fundamental choice for every software company is ownership of development tools, as the dependence on these is of strategic importance. That is why large software companies used to have their own homegrown development environments. It turns out that the development tools are a source of strategic risk, but not of strategic advantage. As the industry has matured, it turns out that significant portions of these are best moved to an open source model.
An additional fundamental choice for a SaaS provider is: who runs and owns the delivery infrastructure? Again, that infrastructure represents a risk more than a source of competitive advantage. As Netflix puts it: ‚Äúwe are not in the business of building data centers‚Äù. That is why it makes sense to work with IaaS or PaaS providers rather than owning the infrastructure. This will obviously also impact the cost structure as we will see.</p>
<h3 id="cost-structure-cs-1">Cost Structure (CS)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cost-structure-cs-1">#</a></h3>
<p>All business model elements discussed above impact the cost structure.</p>
<p>In more traditional IT service models the revenue streams are tightly coupled to the cost structure. The cloud computing innovation is also about decoupling these.
In software, revenue streams are pretty disconnected from the cost structure. After all, when the software is written, shipping it to customers has very low incremental cost, even though servicing customers has not.
For software as a service this is a little less so, as there is actual infrastructure necessary to support the service.
The cost of that infrastructure is related to the usage volume.</p>
<p>The most significant cost elements related to software development are in creating and maintaining functionality, and in maintaining the development and delivery infrastructure. For the software delivery side there will be costs related to in company server infrastructure or incurred from key partners such as IaaS providers.
Interestingly, for a lot of SaaS companies, most of the development cost is about supporting future customer needs, not current customer needs. An exception could be the bookkeeping firm, which might be tracking tax regulations as they tend to change regularly.</p>
<h3 id="summary-1">Summary<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#summary-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Again we see the business model canvas as a good tool to map out the particularities of cloud provider business models.
It points us to provider particularities and indicates some important strategic choices.</p>

<p>Public cloud migrations come in different shapes and sizes, but I see three major approaches. Each of these brings value in its own way, and they all have very different technical and governance implications.</p>
<h3 id="three-approaches">Three approaches<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#three-approaches">#</a></h3>
<p>Companies dying to get rid of their data centers often get started on a <strong>‚Äòlift and shift‚Äô</strong> approach, where applications are moved from existing servers to equivalent servers in the cloud. The cloud service model consumed here is mainly IaaS (infrastructure as a service). Not much is outsourced to cloud providers here. Contrast that with SaaS.</p>
<p>The other side of the spectrum is adopting <strong>SaaS solutions</strong>. More often than not, these trickle in from the business side, not from IT. These could range from small meeting planners to full blown sales support systems.</p>
<p>More recently, developers have started to embrace cloud native architectures. Ultimately, both the target environment as well as the development environment can be cloud based. The cloud service model consumed here is typically PaaS.</p>
<p>I am not here to advocate the benefits of one over the other, I think there can be business case for each of these.</p>
<p>The categories also have some overlap. Lift and shift can require some refactoring of code, to have it better fit cloud native deployments. And hardly any SaaS application is stand alone, so some (cloud native) integration with other software is often required.</p>
<h3 id="profound-differences">Profound differences<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#profound-differences">#</a></h3>
<p>The big point I want to make here is that there are <strong>profound differences</strong> in the issues that each of these categories faces, and the hard decisions that have to be made. Most of these decisions are about <strong>governance and risk management</strong>.</p>
<p>With lift and shift, the application functionality is pretty clear, but bringing that out to the cloud introduces data risks and technical risks. Data controls may be insufficient, and the application‚Äôs architecture may not be a good match for cloud, leading to poor performance and high cost.</p>
<p>One group of SaaS applications stems from <strong>‚Äòshadow IT‚Äô</strong>. The people that adopt them typically pay little attention to existing risk management policies. These can also add useless complexity to the application landscape. The governance challenges for these are obvious: consolidate and make them more compliant with company policies.</p>
<p>Another group of SaaS applications is the reincarnation of the <strong>‚Äòenterprise software package‚Äô</strong>. Think ERP, CRM or HR applications. These are typically run as a corporate project, with all its change management issues, except that you don‚Äôt have to run it yourself.</p>
<p>The positive side of SaaS solutions, in general, is that they are likely to be cloud native, which could greatly reduce their risk profile. Of course, this has to be validated, and a minimum risk control is to have a good exit strategy.</p>
<p>Finally, cloud native development is the most exciting, rewarding and risky approach. This is because it explores and creates new possibilities that can truly transform an organization.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious balances to strike here is between speed of innovation and independence of platform providers. The more you are willing to commit yourself to an innovative platform, the faster you may be able to move. The two big examples I see of that are big data and internet of things. The major cloud providers have very interesting offerings there, but moving a fully developed application from one provider to another is going to be a really painful proposition. And of course, the next important thing is for developers to truly understand the risks and benefits of cloud native development.</p>
<p>Again, big governance and risk management issues to address.</p>

<p>Promise Theory and Services: Peter explains that a service is actually a set of promises. He discusses how this framework applies to daily work, particularly with customers using services. He contrasts thinking in terms of buying products versus services. He also mentions a book by Jeff Sesna that dives deeper into this.
‚Ä¢
Contracts and Service Level Agreements (SLAs): Peter connects the idea of a contract to a set of complimentary promises, where if one party does something, the other will do something else. He clarifies that an SLA is a type of contract. He also notes that an SLA might be an &ldquo;upstream SLA&rdquo;.
‚Ä¢
Handling Broken Promises: Peter elaborates on what happens if a provider doesn&rsquo;t keep their promise. He discusses standard contractual elements like guarantees or penalties. He also introduces two ways of handling broken promises:
‚ó¶
A hierarchy of contracts/promises, using the example of a restaurant transaction nested within higher-level promises like menu availability and societal promises about restaurant licensing and quality. This hierarchy can extend to international legal levels.
‚ó¶
A game theoretical approach where repeated interactions allow parties to punish each other for broken promises, fostering trust. He mentions the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma and the concept of credible retaliation as part of this.
‚Ä¢
Risk Management: Peter introduces the concept that every promise is a risk and that one significant risk is assuming a promise that is not actually there from a provider. He emphasizes that risk management involves finding somebody who suffers a bad consequence when a service isn&rsquo;t working. He also contrasts the compliance perspective on risk (assuming internal is better than external) with potentially different &ldquo;real&rdquo; risks.
‚Ä¢
Diagram Analysis and Application of Frameworks: Regarding the project diagram Maria shared, Peter explains it as a deployment diagram showing data, processing, control boundaries (the boxes), and communication/messages (the lines crossing boundaries). He then explains how to apply the concept of service agreement items and promises to each boundary crossing in the diagram.
‚Ä¢
Zero Trust Principles: In the context of the diagram and sensitive data flow, Peter introduces Zero Trust principles. He explains thinking in terms of &ldquo;allow rules&rdquo; for specific transaction flows (e.g., allowing sensitive data to the local LLM but not outside) and showing where there is no &ldquo;allow rule&rdquo; to prevent unwanted flow. He mentions that a policy enforcement point would be where this control is implemented.
‚Ä¢
Intervention Layers for Governance/Controls: When discussing the complexity of risk, architecture, and zero trust, Peter suggests thinking in terms of intervention layers. These layers range from stopping specific data flow, to watching the controls, to ensuring people understand policies, up to the policy-setting level itself. He notes that if a higher-level control isn&rsquo;t there, &ldquo;you are the higher level control&rdquo;, though acknowledging enforcement challenges. He suggests starting at a lower level and scaling up.</p>
<hr>
<p>A great way to look at how value is created in interactions between autonomous actors is game theory.
How do autonomous actors respond to other actors?
This is the core question here.
How do you respond to an offer from a service provider? But also, how do they respond to you?</p>
<p>I have found game theory to be an effective model to think about the outcomes of sequences of interactions.
This is because it clearly identifies the actors (or players) and their interests.</p>
<p>I use this all the time to think about how I relate to other parties that I choose to work with, or just have to work with.
It also helps me to understand how parties and stakeholders act upon one another.</p>
<p>A game, in this view, has a number of <em>players</em>, who make <em>moves</em> that result in <em>payoffs</em>. The payoffs are defined by the rules of the game.</p>
<p>A simple example is <a href="/ttt/tic-tac-toe">tic-tac-toe</a>, where players take turns (make moves) in marking an X or O on a 3x3 board.
Whichever player first aligns three in a row wins.
The win is called the payoff.</p>
<p>A <em>strategy</em> is a plan for the moves that you are going to make.
A <em>winning strategy</em> is one that always wins, despite the moves of opponents.
By the way, there is no winning strategy for tic-tac-toe.
The best you can hope for is an opponent&rsquo;s mistake.</p>
<p>The digital infrastructures world has many examples and applications of this.
One example can be found by looking at a simple provider-consumer relationship.</p>
<p>In this relationship, the provider pools resources such as bandwidth and servers for multiple consumers, and charges a certain price to them.
The moves they make are setting a price and setting the size of the pool of resources.</p>
<p>The consumers&rsquo; moves, simply stated, are to buy the service from this provider, or not, and to consume the service, or not.</p>
<p>The rules of the game are that the more consumers use the same pool, the less performance they get, which reduces their payoff.
Think of the cake at a birthday party: the more guests there are, the smaller the slice each gets.
Note: for the consumer this is an example of an externality (an outside factor that influences the value), which we discuss elsewhere.</p>
<p>The payoff for the provider is the amount of revenue they get.
Having more users results in more revenue.
The payoff for the consumers is the performance they get.</p>
<p>As a provider, you are probably looking for a strategy that maximizes your payoff, by balancing between having too much expensive capacity, or by alienating consumers by not having enough capacity.
I once consulted an Internet Services Provider on how to play that game.</p>
<h2 id="contracts-are-games">Contracts are games<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#contracts-are-games">#</a></h2>
<p>Whenever you enter into a contract, you are also entering a game.
The contract specifies the rules of the game, the allowable moves, and their payoffs.</p>
<p>When you sign up for a mobile phone subscription, your allowable moves include making calls and sending text messages.
Each of these moves has a payoff.
Part of the payoff is the charge from the mobile operator, and that is part of the contract.
Terminating your contract is also a move, and the contract specifies your notice period.</p>
<p>Contracts between business entities often get a lot of scrutiny from lawyers.
An important part of the work of those lawyers is figuring out what the game is.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the moves?</li>
<li>What are the payoffs?</li>
<li>Do other parties have a strategy that gives us negative payoffs?</li>
</ul>
<p>Negotiating a contract means trying to establish the rules of the game.
These rules will apply when the contract goes into operation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, and confusing to some, is that negotiating a contract is a game in itself.
The moves are the various proposals, clauses, and amendments that are made.
The payoff is a contract, which hopefully has value.
But abandoning the negotiations is also a move.
Negotiation experts therefore urge you to consider the payoff beforehand.
BATNA, or Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement, represents your moves if a negotiated agreement fails.
Understanding it gives you power in a negotiation.</p>
<h2 id="taking-a-risk-is-a-game">Taking a risk is a game<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#taking-a-risk-is-a-game">#</a></h2>
<p>Whenever you make a bet, or take a chance, you are playing a game.
In roulette for example, you are playing against chance.</p>
<p>You make a move, put your money on a color or a number, the table turns, and your payoff is either negative, you lose your money (likely), or you win and you get X times your bet (less likely).</p>
<p>Statistics helps you figure out what you can expect to win (or lose, as the case may be) based on your strategy.
If you play in a casino, you can assume that the casino has a winning strategy, and you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In cybersecurity we are playing games all the time.
For example: your software has a vulnerability.
Vulnerabilities may lead to hacks, where your data gets stolen, or other bad things happen.
Your move is to either fix it (negative payoff, as it is an effort) or not (zero payoff).
Then you either don&rsquo;t get hacked (zero payoff) or you are (big negative payoff).
Statistics won&rsquo;t help you much here.
If a vulnerability is easy to exploit, it will be exploited eventually.</p>
<h2 id="cheating-is-a-game">Cheating is a game<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cheating-is-a-game">#</a></h2>
<p>Cheating is a game too.</p>
<p>The cheater is taking a risk.
If they are not found out, they win.
If they get caught, they lose.</p>
<p>The move is clear, as is the payoff.</p>
<p>But it gets more interesting when two cheaters play together.
One example of that is the game called the &ldquo;prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma&rdquo;, which we will discuss in another unit.</p>
<h2 id="change-the-game">Change the game<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#change-the-game">#</a></h2>
<p>Automation often allows us to change the game, or at least change its rules and payoffs.</p>
<p>Consider the following practice.
When software is changed, it may have new bugs.
That is why software is tested before it goes to production.
But testing costs money, so the game is the following.</p>
<p>Consider a test, now decide whether to run it, which is a move that brings cost, or don&rsquo;t run it, and risk that it goes bad in production, which may bring a lot more cost.
That is the game as it was customarily played before around 2010.</p>
<p>Enter: automatic testing.</p>
<p>If you automate the tests, you will significantly reduce the cost of running them.
This means you can afford to do them more often, thus reducing the risk of bugs getting into production.</p>
<p>Now you are playing a different game.
What are the tests that you are going to automate first?
Automating tests costs money.
The payoff is finding important bugs earlier.
The move is to automate, or not.</p>
<p>This is a classic investment game. Do I invest in something, such as buying a server, and getting the payoff of low usage costs, or rent a cloud server, and have the payoff of not spending a lot of money upfront?</p>
<p>Understanding the games being played also helps understanding how power flows, because it shows how decisions by actors (moves by players) lead to outcomes such as benefits and costs.
Game theory shows that benefits are not always reaped by those who can influence them.</p>
<p>Moves by one player can influence the moves by other players, because it influences their payoffs.
In tic-tac-toe there are often forcing moves that leave the opponent only one choice except to lose.
That also is power of one player over the moves of another player.</p>
<p>In a similar way, tech providers influence the choices of their consumers.
A game a tech provider likes to play is &lsquo;vendor lock-in&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Once a consumer has started using a particular service, there will be a cost associated with switching to different provider.
This is known as the switching cost.
Providers can make several moves:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep switching costs as low as possible, which will make it easy for customers to switch</li>
<li>drive up switching costs, of which the payoff is higher revenue</li>
<li>drive up switching costs to a really high level, of which the payoff is that they won&rsquo;t be getting many new customers anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p>Customers can make defensive moves, if they plan ahead.</p>
<p>And often, regulators step in to keep switching costs down, in order to protect customers.
Phone number portability is an example regulatory move.</p>
