<p>Most digital infrastructures are meant to communicate or coordinate, or are in support of other digital infrastructures that communicate or coordinate.
That is where their prime value is.</p>
<p>The internet is a great example. It is designed to enable computers to communicate by moving data packets between them.</p>
<p>Social media is another example, used by people to communicate with each other. Its success is a testament to the fact that communication is a fundamental human need.</p>
<p>For an example of a supporting digital infrastructure you can look at an IaaS provider, which enables data processing and storage for other applications and infrastructures.</p>
<p>From a business perspective this communication and coordination can lead to value in the form of, amongst others:</p>
<ol>
<li>better resource utilization and less waste,</li>
<li>better process efficiency,</li>
<li>better quality of services and products,</li>
<li>reduction of risks.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just the major, broad categories of delivering value, and there is considerable overlap between them. For example an organization&rsquo;s website helps communicate to its customers. But you can also look at it as a more efficient way to organise the coordination on the delivery of products and services to the customer.</p>
<p>As you dive deeper into business processes, you will find that there is a wide range of processes and ways that lead to business value, each of which has its own peculiar ways of communicating and coordinating. In the early days of networking, I was sometimes asked what the value of a network is.
That is a hard questions.
Equally unanswerable is the question what the value of a message is. It just depends on the role that such a message plays in a process. For example, if your house is on fire, you only need a small message to reach the fire department, but if it does not get there, you&rsquo;ll lose a house.</p>
<p>Strategy consulting firms, like the one I worked at, do a lot of work in process reengineering to create value for their clients. The larger firms have serious collections of proces improvements. Over the past decades, significant reengineering of supply chains has taken place. The core idea of that is typically that better coordination reduces risk and inefficiencies.</p>
<p>I think that just about any process can be improved with more information and communication.
The questions remain: at what cost, which stakeholders will benefit, and which stakeholders will experience negative results.</p>
<hr>
<p>Consumers of digital infrastructures benefit from not running them themselves, but having a provider who serves more consumers do it for them.</p>
<p>Imagine stringing a wire to connect your PC to your neighbour&rsquo;s PC in order to play a game together. People have been doing these things. How long does it take to string the wires and connect them? What is the cost? Where do you buy the cable? How are you going to run that cable? It is a lot faster to just use the internet for that.</p>
<p>The introduction of a separate provider changes the provisioning process. For one thing, the provisioning can go much faster. The provider has capacity (stock so to say) that can just be used. Related to that is that the service is already defined by the provider. Instead of designing it from scratch, you just pick one of the options offered. Presumably, that option has had a lot of design and thinking behind it already. It is likely to be a better option than anything that you can think of yourself.</p>
<p>So, that brings value: it can be faster and better than your homegrown alternatives.</p>
<p>Because the provider has multiple consumers, there are economies of scale that play out. Whole books have been written on this, and we will be looking into that in more detail. Think of sharing of unused capacity. Not everybody is using their internet link to the max all the time.</p>
<p>But &lsquo;digital&rsquo; brings more specific benefits. It is the opportunity to automate service delivery that has immense effects on economies of scale. Think about it: if a piece of software does its work, replicating that piece of software across a lot of servers is a neglible amount of effort in comparison to creating that software, typically. In contrast, baking 1000 pizzas is a lot more work than just baking one or two.</p>
<p>Finally, consumers can find value in being connected with other consumers. The value of a phone or social network to the individual users, not just the network owner, increases with the number of other users connected to it. As a result the value of the network increases quadratically with the number of users. This has implications for the power balance, as we will discuss later.</p>
<p>In a later unit we&rsquo;ll discuss some of the words that economists use for these phenomena, such as investment externalities and network externalities.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Agile development</strong> is all the fashion nowadays. Why is that and what kind of digital infrastructures does that require?
Back in the old days, business software was primarily written to automate <strong><em>existing</em></strong> business processes. Those processes might change somewhat as a result, but in the core processes were no different. Think accounting systems, scheduling, &ldquo;customer relationship management&rdquo; and so on.</p>
<p>Today we see that software not only automates these business processes, but becomes part of the product, or even becomes the product itself. And on top of that, this software is often an on-line service. Think of the smart room thermostat.
Or financial services, where software increasingly is the main part of the product: think online banking. And in social media from Facebook to Tindr, software really is the product.</p>
<h2 id="the-dance">The dance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-dance">#</a></h2>
<p>Every product changes the world that uses it. Think how cars have changed the way people commute, or even choose where they live. Software is no different. But a changing world also changes the products we can use or want to use. There is a kind of dance between supply and demand. Do we have breakfast out of our house more often because there are more opportunities for this or does the supply of breakfast places increase as a result of us going out more? Just as in a dance, it is not always easy to tell who is leading who.</p>
<p>Because software now has become the product it will also participate in the dance, and then it becomes more important to quickly adapt to the dance partner. As a developer, you change the world that uses your software in ways you cannot always predict, so in reaction you have to adapt to that world.</p>
<p>The faster the better.</p>
<p>This explains the need for agile development. Between idea and realization (time to market) there should not be two years, but only two weeks, and preferably less.</p>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-digital-infrastructures-does-that-require">What kind of digital infrastructures does that require?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-kind-of-digital-infrastructures-does-that-require">#</a></h2>
<p>The prime objective of digital infrastructures is to enable the deployment of application functionality. The quality of digital infrastructures used to be measured in the number of users it could support well. I.e. we used to talk about a system supporting 10.000 concurrent users with less than 4 seconds response time.</p>
<p>But agile development comes with a new goal: &lsquo;feature velocity‚Äô. That is the speed with which new features can be deployed. The time between inception of a feature and its deployment to a large user base has to be shorter than the time it takes for the environment to change. In a dance you want to anticipate your partner, not stand on their toes.</p>
<p>Your digital infrastructure should not be a bottleneck. This requires features such as automated testing, quick scaling up and down of resources, and as little manual intervention as possible. This is the only way to shorten the lead time for a change.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-computing">Cloud computing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cloud-computing">#</a></h2>
<p>In summary: agile development requires cloud computing. Remember: the essential characteristics of cloud computing include fast, elastic and self-service provisioning of resources. That is what is required for agile development.</p>
<p>And then the dance continues. Because if we can do that, we can do other new things. Like better security. If you can respond quicker to new functional requirements, you can also respond quicker to security issues.</p>

<h2 id="business-model-canvas">Business Model Canvas<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#business-model-canvas">#</a></h2>
<p>The business model canvas is a visual template for developing and discussing business models. For more information, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas</a> and <a href="http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/">http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/</a>.</p>
<p>The business model canvas has nine basic building blocks and specific relations between those blocks. I&rsquo;ll illustrate them here.</p>
<p>The example used in this section is Amazon Web Services (AWS), particularly EC2 (virtual machines on demand). This is an Infrastructure as a Service offering. The power of the business model canvas approach becomes clear when we see how it can distinguish between various cloud service offerings.
<img alt="IaaS Cloud Canvas" loading="lazy" src="BusinessCanvasIaaS.png"></p>
<h2 id="customer-segments-cs">Customer Segments (CS)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#customer-segments-cs">#</a></h2>
<p>Customer segments are the groups of customers that the company ultimately serves, i.e., the ones that consume and pay for the services.</p>
<p>In the AWS case, although practically anybody with a credit card can spin up a virtual machine, in 2015, Amazon primarily targeted software developers and (startup) SaaS providers as the main customers. Historically, the Amazon development teams were the first customers, and external customers were initially added as an afterthought.</p>
<h2 id="value-propositions-vp">Value Propositions (VP)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#value-propositions-vp">#</a></h2>
<p>Value propositions reflect customer problems and needs. This central element describes why the customer would ultimately pay for the product or service.</p>
<p>The value proposition of a cloud computing service is driven by its five essential characteristics. For example, in the AWS EC2 case, the core component of the value proposition is rapid self-service provisioning of virtual machines with pay-per-use billing. For each individual customer, these translate into different business advantages, like fast provisioning, reduced capital expenditure, and minimized risk of over-investing.</p>
<h2 id="channels-ch">Channels (CH)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#channels-ch">#</a></h2>
<p>Value propositions are delivered to customers through communication, distribution, and sales channels.</p>
<p>It is often assumed that cloud computing relies solely on self-service direct sales, but the reality is much more diverse. SaaS providers, in particular, are developing extensive partner programs. AWS primarily employs a self-service direct model, where delivery is through APIs. The model is enhanced by premium support.</p>
<h2 id="customer-relationships-cr">Customer Relationships (CR)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#customer-relationships-cr">#</a></h2>
<p>Customer relations are established and maintained with each specific customer segment.</p>
<p>One way AWS maintains relationships with its customer segments is through conferences. The 2013 re:Invent developer conference attracted 9,000 visitors. In 2024, the conference, no longer solely focused on developers, drew around 60,000 visitors. Additionally, there are vibrant online communities.</p>
<h2 id="revenue-streams-rs">Revenue Streams (RS)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#revenue-streams-rs">#</a></h2>
<p>Revenue streams result from value propositions that are successfully offered to customers.</p>
<p>The structure of revenue streams is where cloud computing differs from earlier IT service models, as they are usage-based rather than asset-based. AWS charges hourly fees per virtual machine; the bigger the virtual machine, the higher the hourly rate.</p>
<h2 id="key-resources-kr">Key Resources (KR)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-resources-kr">#</a></h2>
<p>Key resources are the assets required to offer and deliver the previously mentioned elements (e.g., value proposition, customer relationships).</p>
<p>AWS owns massive amounts of hardware, estimated at 1 million servers or more in 2015, housed in dozens of data centers worldwide. But there is more. The service can only be delivered through advanced and unique fulfillment software and processes.</p>
<h2 id="key-activities-ka">Key Activities (KA)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-activities-ka">#</a></h2>
<p>At AWS the key activity, delivery, is highly automated. But at the AWS scale, oversight and resources
planning is still a significant effort. Optimizing assets versus utilization is very essential in the IaaS
business model. Through economies of scale, AWS is able to spend a lot of effort on these activities.</p>
<h2 id="key-partnerships-kp">Key Partnerships (KP)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-partnerships-kp">#</a></h2>
<p>Some activities are outsourced, and some resources are acquired outside the enterprise.</p>
<p>AWS buys immense amounts of hardware, and uses a lot of (open source) software. Building out data
centers is also likely to be outsourced.</p>
<h2 id="cost-structure-cs">Cost Structure (CS)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cost-structure-cs">#</a></h2>
<p>All business model elements discussed above impact the cost structure.</p>
<p>In more traditional IT service models the revenue streams are tightly coupled to the cost structure. The
cloud computing innovation is also about decoupling these.
At AWS, the main cost elements are in assets such as servers and data centers, in services such as
electrical power and telecommunications, and in people for managing the systems.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#summary">#</a></h2>
<p>The business model canvas is a useful tool to map out the particulars of cloud provider business models. In this section, we have only looked at the basics of a particular infrastructure provider. For software-as-a-service providers and internal/private cloud providers, the canvas can also be used to discuss their differences.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here is a high level overview of the SaaS provider business model and some of the strategic options that are in there.</p>
<h2 id="business-model-canvas-1">Business Model Canvas<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#business-model-canvas-1">#</a></h2>
<p>The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management tool that serves as a visual framework for developing and discussing business models. To learn more, visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas">Wikipedia</a> or the <a href="http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/">Business Model Generation</a> website.</p>
<p>The Business Model Canvas is composed of nine essential building blocks, which define the interconnections and relationships within a business model. In this article, we&rsquo;ll explore examples using two hypothetical SaaS providers: one offering bookkeeping software and the other a project collaboration platform.</p>
<p><img alt="SaaS Cloud Canvas" loading="lazy" src="BusinessCanvasSaaS.png"></p>
<h2 id="customer-segments-cs-1">Customer segments (CS)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#customer-segments-cs-1">#</a></h2>
<p>In the Business Model Canvas, ‚ÄúCustomer Segments‚Äù are the groups of customers that the company ultimately serves, I.e. the ones that consume and pay for the services.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of the SaaS model that this could basically be anybody, not just IT people. Let us just remind ourselves that customers here are the ones that use the service to get their business done, or get their personal lives in order. In a business context we often also have to distinguish between the user and the organization that purchases the solution. This is very likely true in the case of our bookkeeping software company.</p>
<h2 id="value-propositions-vp-1">Value Propositions (VP)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#value-propositions-vp-1">#</a></h2>
<p>Value propositions reflect the customer problems and needs. This is the central element that describes why the customer would ultimately pay for the product or service.</p>
<p>The essential characteristics of cloud computing may or may not relate directly to the core value proposition of the software application. In our first example, the core value proposition ‚Äîautomated bookkeeping‚Äî is unrelated to cloud computing. Of course cloud computing‚Äôs characteristics give the SaaS proposition an edge above its direct on-premises alternatives even if the functionality would be the same. Self-service provisioning leads to quicker time to deploy, more scalability in usage (whether accounts or transactions), lower investments or commitments, and potentially lower cost.
The value proposition is fundamentally different in the second example, the project collaboration support site. In this example, the cloud&rsquo;s characteristic of broad network accessibility directly enhances the software&rsquo;s usefulness for users spanning company boundaries.
Interestingly, the first provider could use this insight to extend its functionality beyond what would be possible in an on-premises solution. Think collaboration with accountants, suppliers and possibly customers, or channel partners.</p>
<h2 id="channels-ch-1">Channels (CH)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#channels-ch-1">#</a></h2>
<p>Value propositions are delivered to customers through communications, distribution and sales channels.</p>
<p>It is often assumed that cloud computing relies solely on self-service direct sales, but the reality is much more diverse. SaaS providers in particular are developing extensive partner programs.
The typical enterprise software solution is not implemented overnight. It takes attention to change management and alignment on master data for example. That is why system integrators often experience the move from on-premis to SaaS as relatively painless. They are doing the same job on a different environment.
Less invasive SaaS offerings are frequently aggregated in broker portals, commonly referred to as &rsquo;enterprise app stores.&rsquo; These portals add value through consolidated billing, self-service provisioning, identity management, and potentially some data integration. But that is one to paint on another business model canvas.</p>
<p>Another natural extension of the SaaS model is exposing the core functionality through an API. While not directly accessed by the consumer, this does allow integration with other SaaS providers. Our project collaboration software could integrate with an existing cloud storage provider.
The main SaaS channels therefore are direct self-service sales, value added re-sellers, system integrators, and enterprise app-stores. The notion of cloud broker fits in here as well, but dissecting its many shapes and forms is a topic beyond the scope of this section.</p>
<h2 id="customer-relationships-cr-1">Customer Relationships (CR)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#customer-relationships-cr-1">#</a></h2>
<p>Customer relations are established and maintained with each specific customer segment.</p>
<p>The lure of cloud computing is that the provider can have a much more direct relation with the customer than is possible with an on-premis solution. Technically, the provider can potentially see each and every move from the users. Which software builder would not like to be able to see the popularity of every feature in real-time? This allows for much more rapid innovation cycles.</p>
<p>It is not impossible for the loop from idea to wide customer feedback to be closed in a couple of hours.
However, this power can bring the provider in conflict with the consumer who might object to its data being used. As an example that is close to the limit of what might be considered acceptable consider the following case. An on-line bookkeeping service for individuals allows them to categorize payments to merchants. Once enough individuals categorized Danny‚Äôs steakhouse as a restaurant, this can then also be suggested to other clients of Danny‚Äôs. Is it legal to use data from one cloud consumer to deliver value to another? Generally speaking, the answer is no, but it may be acceptable if only aggregate data is used.
Support is often easier on-line, and on-line communities often add considerable value for the consumer.</p>
<h2 id="revenue-streams-rs-1">Revenue Streams (RS)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#revenue-streams-rs-1">#</a></h2>
<p>Revenue streams are the result of value propositions that are successfully offered to customers.</p>
<p>The structure of revenue streams is where cloud computing differs from earlier IT service models. Software firms traditionally relied on licensing arrangements that were somewhat usage based, and could be hard to enforce technically as well as legally.</p>
<p>Cloud computing service models by definition are usage based, and have the potential to be much more closely related to the value that is experienced by the customers. Both our examples enhance the productivity of users, and it is natural to charge per user who has access to the functionality on daily basis. Transactional services such as event management or email delivery are more naturally charged by the transaction, potentially on a bulk basis.</p>
<h2 id="key-resources-kr-1">Key Resources (KR)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-resources-kr-1">#</a></h2>
<p>Key resources are the assets required to offer and deliver the previously mentioned elements (e.g. value proposition, customer relationships).</p>
<p>The core asset of a software company is likely to be its code base, its understanding of consumer requirements and processes, and the staff that does this. For a SaaS provider, this is augmented with actual technical service delivery and understanding of consumer behavior.</p>
<p>It may seem a small matter to go from knowing your software and the way it runs at your customer‚Äôs sites to running the software yourself. Yet, the competencies involved are fairly different.
The most obvious differences between cloud providers and software delivery companies are in multi-tenancy and feature velocity. Every SaaS provider has to think about how multi-tenant his software needs to be to realize the right scalability model for its customers. Feature velocity, the time between inception and go-live is a great competitive differentiator. To achieve this, the provider requires an integrated &lsquo;DevOps&rsquo; organization, demanding significant input from people, processes, and technology.
Then, on the physical asset side, an important question is how much delivery assets the company decided to have. Does it need to own hardware assets or are they sourced from an upstream cloud provider? On the canvas, this represents a trade-off between resource and partnerships.</p>
<h2 id="key-activities-ka-1">Key Activities (KA)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-activities-ka-1">#</a></h2>
<p>The key resources perform key activities.</p>
<p>The obvious key activity at a software company is: develop software. In the long run, these should increase the value of the code base. For a SaaS cloud provider, actually delivering the software as a service is an extension to that. The virtuous circle in a SaaS provider is understanding customer behavior and requirements, translating these into new functionality and delivering this to customers.
For this to be successful on the SaaS scale, it has to be executed as an integrated pipeline. The most advanced organizations get the operational activities out of the way. Developers and product managers are empowered to push features to production. Tests are all automated and the focus of operational staff is not so much into bringing features in production, but to maintain the assets and operational fabric that allow the developers to do that themselves.</p>
<h2 id="key-partnerships-kp-1">Key Partnerships (KP)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#key-partnerships-kp-1">#</a></h2>
<p>Some activities are outsourced, and some resources are acquired outside the enterprise.</p>
<p>A fundamental choice for every software company is ownership of development tools, as the dependence on these is of strategic importance. That is why large software companies used to have their own homegrown development environments. It turns out that the development tools are a source of strategic risk, but not of strategic advantage. As the industry has matured, it turns out that significant portions of these are best moved to an open source model.
An additional fundamental choice for a SaaS provider is: who runs and owns the delivery infrastructure? Again, that infrastructure represents a risk more than a source of competitive advantage. As Netflix puts it: ‚Äúwe are not in the business of building data centers‚Äù. That is why it makes sense to work with IaaS or PaaS providers rather than owning the infrastructure. This will obviously also impact the cost structure as we will see.</p>
<h2 id="cost-structure-cs-1">Cost Structure (CS)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cost-structure-cs-1">#</a></h2>
<p>All business model elements discussed above impact the cost structure.</p>
<p>In more traditional IT service models the revenue streams are tightly coupled to the cost structure. The cloud computing innovation is also about decoupling these.
In software, revenue streams are pretty disconnected from the cost structure. After all, when the software is written, shipping it to customers has very low incremental cost, even though servicing customers has not. For software as a service this is a little less so, as there is actual infrastructure supporting the service. The cost of that infrastructure is related to the usage volume.</p>
<p>The most significant cost elements related to software development are in creating and maintaining functionality, and in maintaining the development and delivery infrastructure. For the software delivery side there will be costs related to in company server infrastructure or incurred from key partners such as IaaS providers.
Interestingly, for a lot of SaaS companies, most of the development cost is about supporting future customer needs, not current customer needs. An exception could be the bookkeeping firm, that might be tracking tax regulations as they tend to change regularly.</p>
<h2 id="summary-1">Summary<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#summary-1">#</a></h2>
<p>Again we see the business model canvas as a good tool to map out the particularities of cloud provider business models. It points us to provider particularities and indicates some important strategic choices.</p>

<p>Public cloud migrations come in different shapes and sizes, but I see three major approaches. Each of these brings value in its own way, and they all have very different technical and governance implications.</p>
<h2 id="three-approaches">Three approaches<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#three-approaches">#</a></h2>
<p>Companies dying to get rid of their data centers often get started on a <strong>‚Äòlift and shift‚Äô</strong> approach, where applications are moved from existing servers to equivalent servers in the cloud. The cloud service model consumed here is mainly IaaS (infrastructure as a service). Not much is outsourced to cloud providers here. Contrast that with SaaS.</p>
<p>The other side of the spectrum is adopting <strong>SaaS solutions</strong>. More often than not, these trickle in from the business side, not from IT. These could range from small meeting planners to full blown sales support systems.</p>
<p>More recently, developers have started to embrace cloud native architectures. Ultimately, both the target environment as well as the development environment can be cloud based. The cloud service model consumed here is typically PaaS.</p>
<p>I am not here to advocate the benefits of one over the other, I think there can be business case for each of these.</p>
<p>The categories also have some overlap. Lift and shift can require some refactoring of code, to have it better fit cloud native deployments. And hardly any SaaS application is stand alone, so some (cloud native) integration with other software is often required.</p>
<h2 id="profound-differences">Profound differences<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#profound-differences">#</a></h2>
<p>The big point I want to make here is that there are <strong>profound differences</strong> in the issues that each of these categories faces, and the hard decisions that have to be made. Most of these decisions are about <strong>governance and risk management</strong>.</p>
<p>With lift and shift, the application functionality is pretty clear, but bringing that out to the cloud introduces data risks and technical risks. Data controls may be insufficient, and the application‚Äôs architecture may not be a good match for cloud, leading to poor performance and high cost.</p>
<p>One group of SaaS applications stems from <strong>‚Äòshadow IT‚Äô</strong>. The people that adopt them typically pay little attention to existing risk management policies. These can also add useless complexity to the application landscape. The governance challenges for these are obvious: consolidate and make them more compliant with company policies.</p>
<p>Another group of SaaS applications is the reincarnation of the <strong>‚Äòenterprise software package‚Äô</strong>. Think ERP, CRM or HR applications. These are typically run as a corporate project, with all its change management issues, except that you don‚Äôt have to run it yourself.</p>
<p>The positive side of SaaS solutions, in general, is that they are likely to be cloud native, which could greatly reduce their risk profile. Of course, this has to be validated, and a minimum risk control is to have a good exit strategy.</p>
<p>Finally, cloud native development is the most exciting, rewarding and risky approach. This is because it explores and creates new possibilities that can truly transform an organization.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious balances to strike here is between speed of innovation and independence of platform providers. The more you are willing to commit yourself to an innovative platform, the faster you may be able to move. The two big examples I see of that are big data and internet of things. The major cloud providers have very interesting offerings there, but moving a fully developed application from one provider to another is going to be a really painful proposition. And of course, the next important thing is for developers to truly understand the risks and benefits of cloud native development.</p>
<p>Again, big governance and risk management issues to address.</p>
