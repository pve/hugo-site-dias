With only a small prompt, we can have the AI generate a complete research report, or term paper, or nice new image. Yes, it looks like that, but the inference engine that takes your prompt, also takes in a huge model and combines the two into a new artefact, which is a lot smaller than your prompt and the model together. And in fact, the model itself is the result of processing huge amounts of training data.\nBut, the information that is the result of this reduction can be more valuable. Less is more.
