      <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to illustrate the development of technology through tracking the development of LLM related tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2023 (check) ChatGPT came out.
Within days people from around the world were using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RAG - companies
Langchain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCP and A2A&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should have acted on the first signals more aggressively. But letâ€™s talk about that later in this story.
Here is the story of my site being infected with malware, viewed by a professional cloud security expert. So I am going to apply all that cloud security theory to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hack led to business damage at the end of one of my webinars. In 2016, on a Friday, I did a webinar, at the end of which I had two links to my site as a call to action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Small Example of Cloud Native Development</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/cases/tutorial-cloud-native/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cloud-native software development enables new practices. But it also requires them. It is a new level of working. However, putting all these new practices together requires integrating a lot of pieces.
To illustrate this new approach, I have started to develop a minimal application. Although minimal, I run it in production. Its basic function is to regularly pull out data from an air quality sensor into a cloud-based database. Together it is a few hundred lines of code.
Here are the major features of the example:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Controlling Cloud Sprawl in 2012</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/cases/stopping-senseless-sprawl-of-private-clouds/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even in a cloud world, reducing server count is a lofty goal in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, you would be paying for all those servers anyway. Understand that sticking all your servers in a private cloud makes them more flexible, but not necessarily more efficient or cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2012 I did an interview with a guy who has a full time job in keeping those server counts down. Ron Kaminski is a capacity planner at Kimberly Clark Corporation (KCC). This interview is a composite of several conversations I had with Ron at the annual Computer Measurement Group (CMG) conferences, and a number of messages Ron wrote.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
