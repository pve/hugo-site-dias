<p>Change is quite inherent in technology, and in particular in information technology.
At the same time we want technology to provide a reliable service, and that requires a degree of control.
In this chapter we&rsquo;ll explore some fundamentals of change, in particular how this works with groups of people.</p>
<p>Change and control mindsets complement each other.
We need both, even if they conflict at times.</p>
<p>For example, in a typical IT environment, you have developers and system administrators.
The output of the developers is a stream of changes: new features, improvements, bug fixes, and so on.
Adminstrators are in the business of keeping everything stable, the same.
They see no fundamental difference between a new feature and an incident. Both are disrupting the normal flow of business. Consequently, they are seen as a threat, and that is why it often feels that developers and system administrators are from different planets.</p>
<p>Part of running a smooth IT function is juggling the balance between change and control.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are many ways to influence and control a system, but one of the most controlled (pun intended) ways is to use feedback loops.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with an analogy first: driving a car.</p>
<p>If you want the car to stop as fast as possible, it suffices to push the brakes as hard as you can. But that does not give you much control.
For example, your passengers might not like it, and it leads to wear on the tires.
If you want the car to stop at an intended location, for example just in front of a traffic light, you apply a feedback loop.</p>
<p>Another example is keeping the car in the proper lane on the road.
Such a loop starts by observing the state, asking: where are we driving? Then we figure out how that differs from the middle of the lane, which is presumably where we want to be driving. Based on that difference (the error) we turn the steering wheel. That is the control we apply. The car will respond, after which we can observe a new state. This closes the loop.
We feed back information from observing the car into the control.</p>
<p>Cars are full of feedback loops. Some are mechanical, some automatic, some have a human in the loop. And some exist outside the car, such as traffic control systems.</p>
<p>We typically want the feedback loops to keep (or bring) the system in a specific state.
In our car example: we want the car to be driving nicely along the highway.</p>
<p>For the feedback loop to lead to this result the feedback should be negative, meaning that deviations from the desired state are counteracted, instead of amplified.</p>
<p>There is a lot of theory on these types of control systems, for example to figure out if they work fast enough at an acceptable cost.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some examples of feedback loops in digital infrastructures.</p>
<p>Large websites have so-called autoscalers. If the load on the website increases, for instance because the website is suddenly in the news, or it is Black Friday on a shopping site, the autoscaler can spin up more webservers to handle that load.
It acts by observing the web traffic and the delays in handling that, and controls the amount of servers that are active.</p>
<p>In the early days of the internet, I advised a retail internet service provider.
At the time, those were independent companies, not part of the telecommunication companies.
They were growing very rapidly, and as a result they experienced quality issues.
Consumers found that web downloads were too slow, and threatened to leave.
The cause of this was that the company was not adapting its connection to the internet fast enough.
That connection was a large part of the cost of running the provider, so they did not want to buy too much too early.
To fix this, I created a control rule through which they could better balance between spending too much on bandwidth and disappointing consumers.</p>
<p>Feedback also makes AI deep learning systems work. The neural network is given a series of training data. The output is checked for correctness, and on the basis of the errors, the weights in the network are adjusted. Repeat this long enough on enough processors, and the errors will drop. The network has then learned.</p>
<p>Feedback loops are everywhere.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you download a large file from a server, the server will adjust its sending rate to whatever the network and the receiver can handle.</li>
<li>When a cloud provider gets more customers, it will adjust the server capacity it has, and it will also adapt the staffing of its support center.</li>
<li>In cybersecurity, we observe the patching level of software components against known vulnerabilities, and update the software as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding feedback loops helps you understand how control can be applied.</p>

<p>How to fix the WiFi? How to find a new phone for grandma?</p>
<p>Applying technology follows certain rules. However, many people only have an intuitive understanding of these rules. As a result, technology is not optimally applied.
By understanding how applying technology really works, you can be more effective, more efficient, reduce waste, and overall do a better job. It takes just a few simple steps to improve any attempt at applying technology. We&rsquo;ll focus on information technology here, though most principles have wider applicability.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start by looking at a few examples that I have used in teaching IT students. The first example is fixing the WiFi at home, and the second one is selecting a new mobile phone for grandma. Think for a moment how you would approach these two cases. If you want a more corporate example you can think of replacing a content management system, or introducing a new security capability.</p>
<p>The core idea of technology is that by doing an <strong>intervention</strong> in the real world, you achieve certain <strong>desirable outcomes</strong>. This is in contrast to the core idea of science, which is that by doing observations on the real world, we can derive certain conclusions that allow us to predict what might happen under similar conditions in the future. Science seeks to understand and explain the underlying principles governing phenomena, while technology applies that understanding to create tools, systems, or processes that achieve specific goals.</p>
<p>Of course, science and technology are intertwined: technology relies on scientific insights to be more effective, while science often needs technology in order to do experiments and observations.</p>
<p>As our ambition is to apply technology in a bit more systematic way, let us begin to ask ourselves what it is that we try to achieve.</p>
<p>By the way: technology literally means the science of technics. In English there is not much of a distinction between techniques and technology.</p>
<p>A technique aims to achieve a certain desirable outcome. Interestingly enough, the attention is often on the technique, and a little less on the outcome. I find that focussing on the outcome first is a productive and relevant thought exercise.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s review our examples. What does fixing the WiFi mean? What result does it achieve? This could be many things. Maybe we want a better internet experience in the back of our garden or on the top floor? Maybe we want to have higher internet speeds inside the house. Maybe we want less packet loss. Maybe we want to play our games with less ping delay, so we can win more often. Maybe we want to allow our friends easier access, or more security.</p>
<p>The essence of the result is that some measurement of quality improves for some stakeholder.</p>
<p>Turning our attention to grandma&rsquo;s new phone, what do we want to be improved? Maybe her current phone is too hard to navigate because the buttons are too small, or it does not run an app that allows her to see the pictures of her grandchildren. Or maybe it breaks down all the time, and your tech savvy nephew has to come over to fix it, and he does not want to do that as often anymore.</p>
<p>Now we can turn our attention to the intervention. In our WiFi case, are we buying more access points, and if so, where should they go, and how should they be connected? Maybe we want to change the frequency allocations, or allow use of the 5GHz frequency bands. With grandma&rsquo;s phone, do we install new apps, buy a different size phone, or what?</p>
<p>How does the intervention lead to the desired result? In other words: how does one lead to the other? Maybe you have a (scientific) <strong>theory</strong> about that. Maybe you&rsquo;ll just need to figure it out. In both cases, you start with a hypothesis that explains how the intervention leads to a result.</p>
<p>For example: because WiFi signal strength (and therefore quality) decreases with distance between device and base station, we install more base stations in order to have better quality around the house. Another example would be: because there is limited frequency spectrum, we reconfigure our existing base stations to use different frequencies in order for them to interfere less, and have better network quality within their range.</p>
<p>As you can see from this example, your assumptions, your hypotheses, matter.</p>
<p>We can morph these statements in a variety of useful ways. This is what makes for professional application of technology. Here are some variations.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By theory Z, we do intervention X to achieve result Y.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We hypothesize that intervention X will lead to result Y, in which case we can start to form a theory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does intervention X lead to desirable outcomes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are looking to achieve result Y, and we have theory Z. What does that tell us about possible interventions?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Once we grasp this, we can move on to more complicated scenarios. We can flesh out what a better outcome is. We can use this to do design in more complicated situations such as with more stakeholders. We can also use this to do more systematic troubleshooting.</p>
<p>More about that later.</p>
<hr>
<p>An important part of managing digital infrastructures is updating various software components.
It does not matter if we are talking about operating systems, applications, AI models, configurations, software libraries, and so on.</p>
<p>What matters is: who is going to do that?</p>
<p>Updates happen for many reasons, but the major ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>new functionality</li>
<li>better security.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can imagine, there are different stakeholders for these changes, and different skill sets required.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s environment, whether we are using cloud or not, there is a division of labor and expertise.
This can be within a company, or across many service providers.
Figuring this out is an example of applying <em>shared responsibility</em> models.
Ideally, a cloud service comes with a clear shared responsibility model that explains who is supposed to do what.
What is it the cloud provider does, what is an external service provider doing, and what should cloud consumers do themselves?</p>
<p>A great way to then detail out the responsibilities is by using the terminology of <em>promise theory</em>, which is discussed elsewhere in this book.</p>
<p>Here are some examples from service providers:</p>
<ul>
<li>We promise to prevent unauthorized access to these systems.</li>
<li>We promise to maintain a particular system according to vendor best practices.</li>
<li>We promise to make sure that there is a spare copy of your data off site.</li>
<li>We promise to apply updates and improvements.</li>
<li>We promise to answer your call to the service desk.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not just about doing tasks, it is also about specifying what the conditions and outcomes are.
You don&rsquo;t just want updates done, you want them done within a certain period of time.
In that way, others can depend on that, with less coordination and overhead.</p>
<p>A SaaS provider promises to update its operating systems, libraries, configurations, for example.
An IaaS provider does <em>not</em> promise to update the operating system on your virtual machine.
In fact, they might even promise that they will <em>not</em> have access to it.</p>
<p>Most people are familiar with calling a service desk (or customer support in general) for help. Historically, this has often been a frustrating experience. That is why it is important to have quality attributes with them, such as &rsquo;time to respond&rsquo; (which typically means, the time it takes for somebody to start working on it), and escalation paths.</p>
<p>For software updates, you can think of quality attributes such as time to update after a new version has been tested.</p>
<p>In a complex multi-provider environment, one of the most important things about promises is, who is making them.
Many security issues have been the result of a responsibility falling in the cracks between two parties, where both think the other is taking care of it.</p>
<p>Digital infrastructure management requires clearly defined responsibilities and quality promises from all parties to ensure timely and secure updates, preventing security gaps due to ambiguous responsibilities.</p>
<hr>
<p>As we mature processes, they come within reach of actual automation. Especially IT management processes. To paraphrase General Carl von Clausewitz, who said &ldquo;War is the continuation of diplomacy with different means&rdquo;, we can say that automation is the progression of process maturity with different means - replacing human effort with software and systems.</p>
<p>My favorite historical example is IP address allocation. In the past, whenever there was a new computer, you would walk up to the head of the lab or data center and ask for a new IP address for that machine. You may remember that.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d go to the person in charge for an IP address, they&rsquo;d pull out their notebook, sharpen their pencil, and note it down. Simple, manual, and not built for scale.</p>
<p>In 1994 I went to a Unix systems administration conference and they had Mike O&rsquo;Dell over from the USA.
He had a <a href="https://archief-website.nluug.nl/activiteiten/events/vj94/abstracts/Mike.ODell.html">presentation about the internet</a> where he talked about many layers of technology to just push IP packets around. I was impressed by the number of layers back then, but I think what he was trying to say was how wasteful it really was, and that many of these things had to be re-engineered to allow the internet to grow.</p>
<p>As a side note, it grew by a factor of 500-1000 in number of users in the thirty years since. At the time of the conference there were about a 1000 websites worldwide, and this conference is the first one listed on the NLUUG website.</p>
<p>We talked with him in the bar afterwards, where he said: &ldquo;You know, next year Microsoft&rsquo;s going to come out with a new version of Windows (editor note: Windows 95) and that will have an internet protocol stack built in to the operating system. They&rsquo;re planning to sell 150,000 of those every month&rdquo;. That sounded like a staggering amount.
Can you imagine how many IP addresses that will be right? How are we going to manage these? We need more pencils!</p>
<p>Then he mentioned that Microsoft collaborated with the IETF to define an automated system for IP address allocation. That standard we now know as DHCP, and it is also in every PC and practically every network. It very likely has reduced many errors that happened in the traditional process, such as duplicate IP addresses being handed out.</p>
<p>What we see here is that a process (address allocation) matured enough for it to be automated. Consequently, it can scale up, and it can be of higher quality.</p>
<p>Another perspective on this is that this activity largely fades into the background of the system administration domain, and becomes part of the technical digital infrastructure. This is a very common pattern in IT, systems administration, and in digital infrastructures in particular.</p>
<p>Compare how assemblers and compilers were heralded in the early days of writing software as making programmers redundant. Well, automation did not make them redundant, it just made them write software on a much higher level of abstraction, leading to more productivity and more quality. The same thing happens in systems administration: as parts get automated, admins operate at a higher level.</p>
<p>In the late eighties, a university colleague of mine, now a retired professor, was doing his PhD on network management architectures‚Äîa concept that was quite elusive at the time. What did network management entail? How would it be standardized? Back then, the idea of computer networks was still new, and automating their management seemed unnecessary because there were so few computers. However, once networks started to scale, network management became much more critical.</p>
<p>His research focused on SNMP and similar technologies. Just as DHCP automated address allocation, SNMP helped manage network measurements and settings. Ultimately though, he concluded that network management encompasses everything not yet automated into a protocol. Again, this represents a maturity story: human management handles what we cannot automate (yet).</p>
<p>That is the cycle of digital development: from manual effort to mature processes to automation‚Äîand then on to the next layer of complexity.</p>
<hr>
<p>Understanding the technical architecture of digital infrastructures is critically important, in particular for <em>non-technical</em> professionals.</p>
<p>I have spent more than a decade educating people on cloud security, for example through certifications such as the <a href="https://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/ccsk/">Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK)</a>, organized by the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), and the <a href="https://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/ccsp/">Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP)</a>, as organized by (ISC)2.
These bodies of knowledge cover a lot of ground, and most of it is related to digital infrastructures at scale.</p>
<p>My students come from many different backgrounds, each bringing with them a unique set of experiences that color their understanding of the way the cloud is managed and controlled.
This is the reality in practice, because secure cloud adoption is a team sport where diverse backgrounds count in order to reduce the risk to organizations.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-technology-architecture">What is technology architecture?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-is-technology-architecture">#</a></h2>
<p>Architecture is often used to mean the overall structure of something, and technology architecture then describes how various technology components fit together.</p>
<p>Cloud computing, in my opinion, does not have that much new technology. Most of the technology we have today was already in existence before the advent of cloud computing.
Today, a common characteristic of the technologies that are relevant for cloud computing is the fact that they facilitate resource pooling and interconnection of systems.
Resource pooling is an essential characteristic of cloud computing, and a technology such as server virtualization helps implement that sharing.
But server virtualization should also guarantee proper separation between otherwise independent cloud tenants.</p>
<p>Technologies such as APIs and federated identity management allow the cloud to be made up of a lot of collaborating independent companies. This helps create an IT supply chain. Your average company has hundreds of SaaS suppliers who in turn use hundreds of other cloud companies to help them deliver their services.
APIs also enable the essential cloud characteristic of automatic self-service provisioning. For example, through APIs we can set up auto-scaling services. Again, this is a tool in building the IT supply chain.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-the-company-boundary">Beyond the company boundary<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#beyond-the-company-boundary">#</a></h2>
<p>The new thing that cloud computing brings is sharing between independent companies, interconnecting different, independent providers and automating that. The whole technology architecture now spans the IT supply chain.
This has big governance and security implications. For example, when that collaboration or isolation fails, we cannot escalate these problems to our own CTO or CIO to resolve them. These problems are not confined to a single company anymore. They have to be resolved <em>between</em> companies.</p>
<p>The technical collaboration between companies will only work with proper contracts and management processes. This has to be set up in advance, instead of figuring out how it works later, as is so common inside an enterprise. And the people whose competence is to review these contracts and set up the service management processes therefore must understand how the technology enables that collaboration.
That is why technology architecture is so important for less technical people. And that is also why it can be hard.
The CCSK body of knowledge focuses specifically on how cloud technology architecture has an impact on cloud management, in particular on cloud risk management, and that makes it a great tool for building effective cloud adoption teams.</p>
<p>Even those who are not involved in day to day technology decisions should still have an understanding of it, because in today&rsquo;s world, it does matter to them.
This always reminds me of a World War 1 quote from the french Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>War is too important a matter to be left to the military.</p>
<p>(La guerre! C‚Äôest une chose trop grave pour la confier √† des militaires.)</p></blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Cloud is too important to leave to technical people.</p>
<p>Cloud distributes responsibility for IT services across an IT supply chain. This supply chain is composed of independent providers. This implies that there are these companies have <strong>technical boundaries</strong> that are matched by organizational and <strong>contractual boundaries</strong>. This is new, we did not have that before the digital revolution.
Amazon calls this the <strong>shared</strong> responsibility model for cloud security.
I would simplify that as:  <em>what do I do, and what do you do</em>? For example, who is responsible for patching the Operating System in an IaaS service model?</p>
<p>Contracts need to fix this allocation of responsibilities, otherwise it is not enforceable. But, who is going to check those contracts? Who needs to make sure that the contracts actually specify those tasks, specify who needs to do them, and specifies how to monitor and enforce that. That is a job for procurement and legal, typically.
Because of that, these people (in this case: procurement and legal) need to understand what the service is. And they need to understand which (technical) tasks are not part of that service.</p>
<p>This is important. Insufficient understanding delays the whole assessment process, and reduces its quality. As one of my course participants, a legal person, once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Äú<em>When I go into a conversation with a cloud provider I have time for let‚Äôs say 10 questions. If all these questions go to understanding basic cloud terminology and technology, I have missed the opportunity to talk about the real risk and opportunity for our company</em>‚Äù.</p></blockquote>
<p>The conclusion must be obvious. Educate your lawyers, procurement and so on. Help them understand the cloud well enough. Help them know where technical boundaries need to be translated into legal controls.</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the years, I have worked with many organizations, large and small.
In one case, I implemented the exact same change in more than 15 organizations, whose size ranged from 35 to 35 thousand employees.
You can imagine that this plays out differently across these organizations.
But that is a story for another unit.</p>
<p>It led me to see patterns in decision making and trust.
Who takes decisions in an organization?
How do people even talk about decisions, especially when they concern digital technology?
Who do you trust?</p>
<p>I have come to identify four major categories.</p>
<h3 id="individuals">Individuals<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#individuals">#</a></h3>
<p>First is the individual, who decides for themselves.
They do not need to consult anybody, though they will be informed by friends and media.
If they want a new app on their phone or laptop, they&rsquo;ll just get it.
And if it breaks, they will fix it themselves.
Or a friend will.
Or maybe not.</p>
<h3 id="small-companies">Small Companies<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#small-companies">#</a></h3>
<p>Second is the small company, with 10-100 persons.
They agree on IT decisions around the lunch table.
And if anything goes wrong, we know who the go to guy is to fix it.
He/she has lunch too, after all.</p>
<h3 id="large-companies">Large Companies<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#large-companies">#</a></h3>
<p>Then we have the large company, more than about 150 people.
Now 150 sounds like a random and weird number, but it is actually based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">scientific result by Robin Dunbar</a>.
It is called Dunbar&rsquo;s number.</p>
<p>In groups with less than 150 people, you can know who you can trust, and who you can&rsquo;t.
When decisions are made, around the lunch table, for example, you can easily know who made the decision, how they made the decision, and why.
And if it does not work out well, you know where your complaints go, who can fix your computer, or help you with that application.</p>
<p>You may not call a company of 150 large, but when groups are larger than that, you can&rsquo;t keep track anymore of who you can trust or not.
That really changes the social and power dynamics.
Instead of knowing people by name, you know them by role.
And the interactions between people are less governed by personal shared histories, but by company shared histories.
These company histories can take the shape of myths, not to be challenged.
In contrast, you can always try to dig deeper in a personal history.
Processes are established, which have to be followed, reviewed, and controlled.
Bureaucracy sets in, and every request has to go through a lot of standardized paperwork.
And it does not matter if this is a government organization, or a large business.
Above a certain size, they all work the same.</p>
<p>Small companies run on trust, large companies run on control.</p>
<h3 id="society-at-large">Society at Large<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#society-at-large">#</a></h3>
<p>The fourth group is a bit different. This is society at large, or your social circles that are a part of it.
They too make decisions on the technologies that will be adopted.</p>
<p>The technology and platform decisions of this category can be as fundamental as that of any of the other categories, but the forces driving them are a little harder to predict.
For example, what is the social media platform that everybody uses?
If all your friends are on a specific social media platform, sharing the fun they have and where the parties are, you are strongly encouraged to go there as well.
And for reasons that we discuss elsewhere, these tend to be &ldquo;winner takes all&rdquo; situations, where one single choice dominates.
Market forces are important here, but also regulatory pressures.
Not to mention other circumstantial influences.</p>
<p>If you want to understand the differences and their impacts, start by looking out for the ways in which digital identities are managed.
This differs widely between small and large organizations, as I have shown here.</p>
<h3 id="in-real-life">In Real Life<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#in-real-life">#</a></h3>
<p>In real life, these categories overlap and influence one another. Often, technology decisions begin as individual choices, which then moves to be adopted by a small group, and then the whole organization.
Large organizations typically consist of a lot of small groups, within which there are different decision cultures.
And small companies often try to sell to large organizations, while misunderstanding the cultural differences between themselves and their prospective customers.</p>
