      <title>Introduction to Change and Control</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Change is quite inherent in technology, and in particular in information technology.
At the same time we want technology to provide a reliable service, and that requires a degree of control.
In this chapter we&amp;rsquo;ll explore some fundamentals of change, in particular how this works with groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change and control mindsets complement each other.
We need both, even if they conflict at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in a typical IT environment, you have developers and system administrators.
The output of the developers is a stream of changes: new features, improvements, bug fixes, and so on.
Adminstrators are in the business of keeping everything stable, the same.
They see no fundamental difference between a new feature and an incident. Both are disrupting the normal flow of business. Consequently, they are seen as a threat, and that is why it often feels that developers and system administrators are from different planets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Systematically applying technology</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How to fix the WiFi? How to find a new phone for grandma?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying technology follows certain rules. However, many people only have an intuitive understanding of these rules. As a result technology is not optimally applied.
By understanding how applying technology really works, you can be more effective, more efficient, reduce waste, and overall do a better job. It takes just a few simple steps to improve any attempt at applying technology. We&amp;rsquo;ll focus on information technology here, though most principles have wider applicability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Network Management Automation - the DHCP case</title>
      <link>http://localhost:42213/book/change/dhcp-automation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we mature processes, they come within reach of actual automation. Especially IT management processes. To paraphrase General Carl von Clausewitz, who said &amp;ldquo;War is the continuation of diplomacy with different means&amp;rdquo;, we can say that automation is the progression of process maturity with different means - replacing human effort with software and systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite historical example is IP address allocation. In the past, whenever there was a new computer, you would walk up to the head of the lab or data center and ask for a new IP address for that machine. You may remember that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why lawyers need to understand cloud</title>
      <link>http://localhost:42213/book/change/lawyers-need-understand-tech/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cloud is too important to leave to technical people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud distributes responsibility for IT services across an IT supply chain. This supply chain is composed of independent providers. This implies that there are these companies have &lt;strong&gt;technical boundaries&lt;/strong&gt; that are matched by organisational and &lt;strong&gt;contractual boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;. This is new, we did not have that before the digital revolution.
Amazon calls this the &lt;strong&gt;shared&lt;/strong&gt; responsibility model for cloud security.
I would simplify that as:  &lt;em&gt;what do I do, and what do you do&lt;/em&gt;? For example, who is responsible for patching the Operating System in an IaaS service model?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
