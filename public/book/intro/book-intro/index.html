<meta name="description" content="How Digital Infrastructures at scale create value, power, and risk: a field guide
The internet is a digital infrastructure at scale. Let’s unpack that for a moment.
It is digital, because it moves bits between devices.
It is at scale, because it moves these bits between billions of devices ranging from websites to mobile phones to robot lawn mowers. (how many?) That is impressive technology, but what keeps that together is the infrastructure part of it. That is what defines the relation between the consumers and the providers, and that is what we are exploring here, as I will show you later.">
