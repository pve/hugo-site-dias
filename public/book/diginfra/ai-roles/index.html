For example, customers should maintain appropriate authorizations of users, and refrain from overloading their providers. Customers are also responsible for the business use of the data that is returned by the AI application.\nThe customer promises:\n“I promise to use AI services responsibly and maintain appropriate authorizations for my users.”\nSecondary promise: “I promise to verify AI outputs before using them for critical business decisions.”\nApplication Provider (AP) These providers build and offer end-user applications that leverage generative AI models for specific tasks such as content creation, chatbots, code generation, and enterprise automation.\nThese applications are often delivered as software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions.\nApplication providers focus on user interfaces, application logic, domain-specific functionality, including retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and overall user experience rather than underlying model development.\nThe application provider promises:\n“I promise to deliver secure, functional AI applications that protect user data and provide reliable service.”\nOrchestrated Services Provider (OSP) This refers to entities that create the technical building blocks and management tools that enable AI implementation.\nThis includes platforms, frameworks, and tools that facilitate the integration, deployment, and management of AI models within enterprise workflows.\nThese providers focus on model orchestration and offer services like API access, automated scaling, prompt management, workflow automation, monitoring, and governance rather than end-user functionality or raw infrastructure.\nThey help businesses implement AI in a structured and efficient manner.\nWhile the lines can be a bit blurry, you can think of OSPs as being independent of specific applications and models.\nThe OSP promises:\n“I promise to provide reliable AI model orchestration, API access, and workflow management independent of specific applications or models.”\nModel Provider (MP) Model Providers are entities that develop, train, and distribute foundational and fine-tuned AI models for various applications.\nThey create the underlying AI capabilities that other actors build upon. Model Providers are responsible for model architecture, training methodologies, performance characteristics, maintenance, and documentation of capabilities and limitations.\nThis is fundamentally about model quality, safety evaluations, and transparent documentation of what the model can and cannot do, and the training data that it is based on. Model providers are responsible for collecting and curating the data on which the model is trained.\nThey operate at the foundation layer of the AI stack and may provide direct API access to their models, at least according to the AICM.\nIn the case of so-called open models, there is a clear case for distinguishing between the responsibilities of the model provider, who effectively just hands over a large file with the trained model, and the ‘inferencing provider’, who completes prompts, as described earlier.\nThe Model Provider promises:\n“I promise to deliver AI models with documented capabilities, limitations, and performance characteristics.”\nCloud Service Provider (CSP) Non-AI specific cloud services for servers, storage, messaging, and more. If you can run a non-AI workload on it, it is probably a cloud service in this definition. An example would be a Kubernetes cluster, or other container orchestration platform.\nBeyond these AI specific roles, we can dig a bit deeper. For example, the AP and OSP may be linking to distinct other services that are outside their direct control, such as document management systems.\nThe Cloud Service Provider promises:\n“I promise to provide compute, storage, and infrastructure capacity as requested.”\nData providers (DP) AI runs on data, and the more specific the data is, the greater its potential in enhancing AI capabilities. A typical use case is to provide access to large collections of company-internal text and images, some of which may be classified and, therefore, should only be accessible to authorized users.\nThese systems are known under that names of DMS (Document Management System), CMS (Content Management System), or intranets.\nA popular approach for integrating text in an AI system is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation). Based on a user query, a selection of documents is retrieved from a data provider and then used in the context window of the large language model model to formulate a targeted response.\nFrom a security perspective, it gets more interesting if not all data should be accessible to everybody. That is why the service of a data provider includes promises such as:\nWhen asked for a document by an authenticated user, I promise to return the best matching answers. I promise to only return answers to which the user is authorized I promise to reveal the document classification to authorized users, but not to others. This makes these data providers enforcers of policy (or PEP in the Zero Trust jargon).\n",

An example would be a Kubernetes cluster, or other container orchestration platform.</p>
<p>Beyond these AI specific roles, we can dig a bit deeper.
For example, the AP and OSP may be linking to distinct other services that are outside their direct control, such as document management systems.</p>
<p>The Cloud Service Provider promises:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise to provide compute, storage, and infrastructure capacity as requested.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="data-providers-dp">Data providers (DP)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#data-providers-dp">#</a></h2>
<p>AI runs on data, and the more specific the data is, the greater its potential in enhancing AI capabilities.
A typical use case is to provide access to large collections of company-internal text and images, some of which may be classified and, therefore, should only be accessible to authorized users.</p>
<p>These systems are known under that names of DMS (Document Management System), CMS (Content Management System), or intranets.</p>
<p>A popular approach for integrating text in an AI system is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).
Based on a user query, a selection of documents is retrieved from a data provider and then used in the context window of the large language model model to formulate a targeted response.</p>
<p>From a security perspective, it gets more interesting if not all data should be accessible to everybody.
That is why the service of a data provider includes promises such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>When asked for a document by an authenticated user, I promise to return the best matching answers.</li>
<li>I promise to only return answers to which the user is authorized</li>
<li>I promise to reveal the document classification to authorized users, but not to others.</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes these data providers enforcers of policy (or PEP in the Zero Trust jargon).</p>
