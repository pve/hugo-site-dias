Power is a concept that is widely used and ill defined. Many philosophers have discussed it, but not one definition really stands out.
Before we attempt to define power formally, let&rsquo;s see how the word in used in everyday IT situations.
Understanding power in IT is not just academic. As the examples show it is crucial in understanding how IT works, and creates value and risk.

The cloud architect held significant power in deciding which platforms the organization would adopt for its digital transformation.
Automated deployment pipelines gave development teams the power to release software faster and with fewer errors.
Legacy systems often retain unexpected power in large organizations, simply because so many critical processes still depend on them.
Regulators have the power to halt digital initiatives if data protection requirements are not met.
By owning the central identity management service, the security team had the power to control access across the entire infrastructure.
Outages at major cloud providers show how concentrated power in digital infrastructures can lead to systemic risk.
The CIO used the power of budget approval to steer the enterprise toward adopting more secure infrastructure patterns.
Power struggles between central IT and business units can delay the rollout of shared infrastructure services.
With real-time observability tools, operations teams gained the power to detect and respond to incidents before users were affected.
An open-source community can collectively wield more power than a single vendor when shaping the direction of a software tool.

From these examples, we can see certain recurring features of power in the context of IT and digital infrastructures.">

<p>Power is a concept that is widely used and ill defined. Many philosophers have discussed it, but not one definition really stands out.
Before we attempt to define power formally, let&rsquo;s see how the word in used in everyday IT situations.</p>
<p>Understanding power in IT is not just academic. As the examples show it is crucial in understanding how IT works, and creates value and risk.</p>
<ol>
<li>The cloud architect held significant power in deciding which platforms the organization would adopt for its digital transformation.</li>

<li>An open-source community can collectively wield more power than a single vendor when shaping the direction of a software tool.</li>
</ol>
<p>From these examples, we can see certain recurring features of power in the context of IT and digital infrastructures.</p>
<ul>
<li>Power can be attributed to people, technical artifacts, teams, organisations as a whole, roles, and institutions, to name a few.</li>
<li>These same types of actors can also be the subjects of power.</li>
<li>Power is exercised through a variety of means and mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<p>In these examples, mechanisms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decision-making authority ‚Äì The ability to choose platforms, policies, or directions.</li>
<li>Technical capability and automation ‚Äì Tools that enable or restrict what actions are possible.</li>
<li>Dependency and path-dependence ‚Äì Power held by systems or practices others rely on.</li>
<li>Legal and regulatory enforcement ‚Äì Influence through rules, compliance, and consequences.</li>
<li>Control over chokepoints ‚Äì Gatekeeping access to critical systems or resources.</li>
<li>Centralization and concentration of infrastructure ‚Äì Power from aggregated control or single points of failure.</li>
<li>Resource and budget control ‚Äì Steering outcomes through funding and prioritization.</li>
<li>Organizational politics and influence ‚Äì Competing agendas, alliances, and negotiation.</li>
<li>Information asymmetry ‚Äì Advantage through greater visibility or data access.</li>
<li>Collective governance and community action ‚Äì Shared power through participation and collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the building blocks of effective IT.
The way these mechanisms are organised plays a critical role in shaping both the value and the risk of digital infrastructures.</p>
<p>A common thread is that power influences the future, and influences the outcomes of activities.
The simplified definition of power, inspired by Oxford Languages, that I use here is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Power is the ability of an actor to direct or influence the behaviour of others or the course of events.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>As our examples show, these actors are not just people - they can include technical artefacts and teams.</p>
<p>Power isn‚Äôt just philosophical‚Äîit‚Äôs operational. It determines what can be built, who gets to decide, and how resilient or risky systems become. To work effectively with digital infrastructure, we need to see power not as abstract, but as architecture.</p>
<hr>
<p>For many people, the word power has a negative connotation.
They&rsquo;d rather avoid using power altogether.
I can feel that, and I can definitely feel that about the abuse of power.</p>
<p>But does that make it unethical to talk about power?
Power is everywhere, and conflict too. There is no society without a power structure.
There are always differences of opinions in any group, if only to decide when to have lunch.</p>
<p>Without exercising power, no group will survive, likely to the detriment of its members.
A former colleague of mine, who served as a lieutenant of an armored infantry platoon, shared many leadership lessons with me.
One crucial lesson was that as a combat vehicle leader, your job is to use your power to choose and enforce a direction in which the group moves as it exits the vehicle in a battle.
It does not matter which direction, as long as everybody moves in the same direction.
To do otherwise endangers the group.
Following the direction of the leader, and their power, is not a concession or a compromise in this case, but a survival tactic.</p>
<p>And when it comes to power abuse, we still need to understand the power in order to understand the abuse, and our possible response to it.
As the famous general Sun Tzu allegedly wrote more than 2000 years ago: &ldquo;If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This understanding of power structures extends to our modern contexts as well.
For example, creating digital infrastructures at scale requires agreements on technical standards. Organisations like the Internet Engineering Task Force and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) create standards that are subsequently used to enforce collaboration on interoperability.
This resolves conflicts between individual companies and benefits all of them.
Successful Open Source projects have clear governance structures which balance power and interests of individuals with that of the community as a whole. Linux, Apache and Mozilla are great examples here.</p>
<p>There is therefore no shame in studying power.
On the contrary, it is morally necessary to reach common objectives and avoid abuse.
Let&rsquo;s continue by diving into some specific power roles.</p>
<hr>
<p>Shared resources can lead to conflicts.
If the capacity runs out, somebody will feel the pain at the expense of somebody else.
This conflict will be resolved in one way or another.
Without other arrangements, the stakeholder with the most power wins.
This is not necessarily the best outcome for the organisation as a whole.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, I gave ChatGPT the following prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a business case story about the conflict over shared computing resources.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here is what it answered. Admittedly, the situation of a single server is a bit old-fashioned. Nevertheless, the principles hold.
Identify some governance concepts in this story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a small startup company called TechPro. They were a team of software developers who needed to use shared computing resources to complete their work. Initially, they all worked on their personal laptops, but as their team grew and their projects became more complex, they needed to access more powerful computing resources.</p>
<p>At first, they decided to use a shared server hosted on-site, but soon they started to experience conflicts over access to the server. Some developers needed to use the server for extended periods of time, while others only needed it for short bursts. Additionally, some developers needed more computing power than others, which led to contention over who had priority access.</p>
<p>As the company continued to grow, these conflicts started to have a significant impact on their productivity. The developers spent a lot of time coordinating access to the server, which led to delays in completing their projects. Some developers even started to look for alternative computing resources outside of the company, which led to security concerns.</p>
<p>The CEO of TechPro recognized the severity of the problem and decided to take action. She tasked the IT department with finding a solution that would allow for fair and efficient sharing of computing resources. The IT department evaluated various options, including adding more servers, using cloud-based resources, and implementing a queueing system for access to the server.</p>
<p>After careful consideration, they decided to implement a queueing system that would prioritize access based on the urgency and computing needs of the tasks. This solution would allow for fair access to the server, as well as efficient use of the resources. The IT department also provided training to the developers on how to use the new system and established clear guidelines for resource usage.</p>
<p>The implementation of the new system was not without challenges, as some developers were resistant to change and preferred the old way of accessing the server. However, with clear communication and support from management, the developers quickly adapted to the new system.</p>
<p>As a result of the solution, TechPro&rsquo;s productivity increased significantly, and the conflict over shared computing resources was resolved. The developers were able to complete their work without delays, and the company was able to retain control over their computing resources. The CEO was pleased with the outcome and praised the IT department for their innovative solution.</p></blockquote>
<p>As an exercise, see which stakeholders you can identify in this example.
You can also think of residual risks of this solution, and other approaches.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the key aspirations of Digital Infrastructures at Scale is to equip you with the tools to shape and drive change in your professional environment‚Äîespecially when your goal is to lead a transformation.</p>
<p>Two important positions of influence in IT are architects and auditors/assessors.</p>
<p>IT architects are builders. They design new applications, platforms, and infrastructures that enable businesses to operate more effectively. A CRM system, for example, is not just a technical solution‚Äîit transforms workflows, communication, and decision-making. Similarly, infrastructure architects create digital foundations that accelerate the deployment of such applications.</p>
<p>Auditors and risk assessors, on the other hand, focus on preventing failure. Every technology introduces risks, and without proper attention, these risks can derail progress‚Äîwhether through security breaches, compliance fines, or operational breakdowns.</p>
<p>Both roles involve power.
Without power, things will not move in the way you want, and every initiative encounters resistance.
Understanding the sources of power‚Äîand the forces that push back‚Äîis essential for you to achieve meaningful outcomes.</p>
<p>Money is a form of power, but it is often a blunt instrument. In organizations, other forces‚Äîsuch as survival and strategic priorities‚Äîcan be even more influential. The key to driving transformation is linking these forces together with precision.</p>
<p>This book provides you with the frameworks, insights, and real-world examples to navigate these challenges and drive successful change.</p>
<hr>
<p>Power does not automatically flow from those that have it to those that are influenced by it.</p>
<p>As they say in dutch, quoting the poet Willem Elsschot: &ldquo;tussen droom en daad staan wetten in de weg, en praktische bezwaren&rdquo;. (&ldquo;between dream and deed stand laws in the way, and practical objections&rdquo;).</p>
<p>We want to understand this. If we want to exercise power, we need to understand the intermediaries. If we want to subvert power, the intermediaries are one of our disruptive points.</p>
<p>The power intermediary aids in applying power. They are like the forward observer in an artillery unit. They don&rsquo;t have the artillery power themselves, but they definitely influence how it is applied. Knowledge is power, as they say.</p>
<p>And there are many more examples of power intermediaries, and many more words that are used to describe that function. You can think of: power broker, facilitator, mediator, intermediary, but in our digital infrastructures world, we can be more specific.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take an example situation.
Suppose the board of a company wants to set a digital strategy for the company, who is in the end implementing and realizing that strategy?
Or, the board wants to demonstrate control over the resilience of the organisation to cyber risks.
In the end, that requires a lot of people and roles, for example in building systems, or doing incident response. Many of these roles are, in fact, power intermediaries, because they facilitate the flow of the board&rsquo;s power to the places in the organisation that matter.</p>
<p>As we discuss elsewhere, this involves people, process and technology.
I also elaborate on two specific positions of power elsewhere: the architect, and the assessor, although they are by no means the only ones.</p>
<hr>
<p>Podcasting has its own digital infrastructures, for example in hosting them.
Let&rsquo;s look at how podcasting has grown, and what made it take off anyway?
Many actors influence each other here, and the state of the art of the technology also has an impact on growth rates.</p>
<p>Suppose a hundred people get told by an enthusiastic friend to try podcasting.
Of these, ten don‚Äôt have any hardware on which they can play the podcasts.
So the rest goes online, and tries to find interesting content, but only 50 people can find a directory in which they can even start to look for podcasts that they like. Only 40 people then find content that they sufficiently like.
Ten people drop out because they find loading the content too complicated. Of these, another ten find out that the files are too big for the hardware they have (for example in 2005, they just had a simple MP3 player, no iPod or similar).
Of the ones left, another five don‚Äôt have the patience for the downloads (we are talking dial-up internet access for a lot of people here, still).
If you have been keeping tabs: we are down to 25 people who are capable and willing to regularly listen to podcasts. Now suppose each of these tells four friends, on the average. That means we are back to a hundred.</p>
<p>Now suppose that all those numbers are a little <em>worse</em> than I have guessed. In that case, any enthusiasm will soon sizzle out.
Now suppose that the numbers are just a little <em>better</em>, so that at the end of the week we have 110 people that are going to try subscribing to podcasting. The week after, it will be 121 people trying, and so on. This represents a growth rate of 10% per week, which amounts to more than a hundred fold increase in a year (12,913 people to be exact).</p>
<p>In fact, all these numbers have been getting better gradually over many several years.
Both the technology and the content were existing as early as 1997. Yet, the gradual increase took until about 2005 to reach what Malcolm Gladwell calls: ‚ÄúThe tipping point‚Äù.
This is when a development, epidemic, or trend just seems to explode.
Obviously, technology has improved, in particular once the iPod was launched, which could store 1000 songs. But something more was going on.</p>
<p>I checked these numbers with Adam Curry, who is regarded by many as the father of podcasting, or &lsquo;podfather&rsquo;.
I found out that he has made a conscious effort to improve the numbers. For example, he developed &lsquo;ipodder&rsquo;, which started as a piece of software to make the mechanics of subscribing to podcasts and getting them on your player easier. Ipodder was a directory to help people find content that is interesting for them. Curry also ran ‚ÄúThe Daily Source Code‚Äù, a regular podcast, as a tool for podcast software developers to test their software.</p>
<p>There is also a tipping point for creators of podcasts, which works in tandem with the tipping point for listeners.
But I will leave you to figure out the details of that yourself.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t really say that one person had the power to force podcasting upon the world, but there was definitely somebody with the insight and the opportunity.</p>

<p>The international arena has many actors that can influence digital infrastructures. But opinions differ on what the important ones are, or even what the relevant ones are.
But the international arena matters, because
by the nature of scaling, very few digital infrastructures are influenced by a single national actor only.</p>
<p>A word of clarification: I am using the word international here to mean all nations in the world, and their interrelations.
In US vernacular, the word international appears to mean all nations, except the US.
Instead, the word global is used to mean all nations, including the US.</p>
<p>The international arena is complex, and there are conflicting views on how it is made up.
These conflicting views can best be seen as maps of the territory. And as I have mentioned earlier, a map is only relevant for a specific purpose.</p>
<p>The first category of actors is nations, obviously. The word nation is part of the word international.
But we can see many other actors exerting influence, such as multinational corporations, NGOs (non-governmental organisations), treaty organisations, and so on.
Let&rsquo;s break this down a bit.</p>
<p>Nations make laws, multinational corporations make investments and offer products, NGOs such as ISO make standards, treaty organisations such as the EU make more standards and regulations. All of these may impact digital infrastructures.
And sometimes these are conflicting.</p>
<p>Not everybody shares this multifaceted view of the international arena. Some hold that nation states are the only actors that have real power. After all, they control the territory on which people live, and have a monopoly on military force and a legal monopoly on violence.</p>
<p>In this view, nations enable the other types of actors through law and agreements within and between them. Multinational corporations don&rsquo;t really exist in this view. They are constructs enabled by agreements between nations, for example on recognizing property across borders. For example, how is it possible that a national of one country can hold property in another country? This is not universally the case. Many countries do not allow this, at least not unlimited.</p>
<p>A multinational corporation, even if it has public shareholders across the globe, has a primary residence somewhere. And the legal options and obligations trickle down from there.</p>
<p>Similarly, NGOs such as ISO (International Standards Organisations) and the International Criminal Court are also established somewhere, and recognized by other countries, or not recognized, as the case may be.</p>
<p>Digital infrastructures don&rsquo;t necessarily map easily to a single organisation running them, or even governing them. The internet is a interesting and complicated example. On a day to day basis, internet service is largely provided by telecommunications companies owning the cables and radio base stations. Administering the coordination between these and other providers, is done by many actors. For example the use of IP adresses is coordinated by a non-profit established in the US. But there are many more players in that space, often independent.</p>
<p>In contrast to the multi-nation view of the world is the perspective that what really matters in the international arena are the multinational corporations. They have significant control over the international flow of goods, services and investments. Understand that many of these corporations have annual turnovers that are larger than the gross domestic product of 80% of the world&rsquo;s countries.</p>
<p>Large businesses have the capability to drive government policies. Even US presidents see that. President Eisenhower warned about the military-industrial complex in 1961. President Biden extended that, and warned against the power of the tech industry and AI in particular in his last speech in 2024.</p>
<p>This is not hypothetical. There has been succesful lobbying by US companies against international regulation that is seen as limiting to them.</p>
<p>Many multinational organisations are largely legitimate, but there are quite a few whose main objective is to launder money outside of the control of nations. Beyond that, when it comes to cybersecurity, internationally organised crime has business models that include ransomware extortion and bitcoin mining on hacked computers.</p>
<p>Then there is the perspective that the only really important international actor is the US.
With more than 700 military bases in more than 80 countries, this is the single largest international military presence in the history of mankind. Additionally, since the end of world war II, the US has alledgedly intervened in dozens of countries, through military or other means, three times more than Russia, the next contender.
By the way, these numbers are hard to validate precisely, though the order of magnitude is uncontested.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the US dollar is the currency of reserve for most of the world, and the US stock markets dominate international capital markets.</p>
<p>As a final alternative perspective, it is conceivable that there are people who think China has always been, and will be, the economic superpower of the world, with a brief 200 year interuption which is about to end.</p>
<p>All these actors may exert power over digital infrastructures.
And to confuse matters even more, these actors do not always acknowledge the power, or even the existence, of other actors.
We&rsquo;ll discuss some examples of this elsewhere.</p>

<p>Technologies are often called disruptive.
But what makes a technology truly disruptive?
What has made the PC a disruptive technology? Or artificial intelligence, for that matter?
And at what time did it become a disruptive technology?
While many would accept that AI was a very disruptive technology starting from 2022 onwards,
most of it was available much earlier. GenAI, chatbots, etc.
Think of ELIZA, the 60s era psychology chatbot by Joseph Weizenbaum.</p>
<p>If we understand the mechanics better, we can begin the see how we can predict these shifts better.</p>
<p>Technology power shifts:
In the early 90s I saw the PC revolution come up and shortly afterwords client-server computing, including all the things that went wrong.
A little later, the Internet revolution from boom to bust, and back up again.
Then, early 2010s, cloud computing exploded, and I started teaching cloud security.
All of these led to dramatic shifts of power in organizations, and therefore in the way IT was organized. Here I&rsquo;d like to explore the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>While there are many uses of the word &lsquo;disruptive&rsquo; in this context, I&rsquo;d like to focus on the degree to which a disruptive technology will shift power in organisations and society.</p>
<p>In my professional career I have seen, as mentioned elsewhere, a few major disruptive changes.
Most of these significantly changed power structures.</p>
<p>The mainframe was typically a central corporate strategic decision, necessitating a corporate IT department.
That also implies that conflicts around its use would percolate to the top. This is one of the essentials of corporate governance.</p>
<p>AI has been around for many years, even decades, but its use really took off after the introduction of a democratized tool that everybody could use: chatGPT.</p>
<p>Power dynamics shift when we introduce new actors in the ecosystem.
For example, minicomputers came within reach of department budgets, causing those departments to also start buying them. ChatGPT allowed people to try out GenAI and apply it to their work.</p>
<p>More affordable access to technology introduces new buyers in the game. Freemium business models make that even more accessible. The game is that value from these services is demonstrated with a free proof of concept, which opens the discussion to talk about bigger budgets. It is part of GitLabs official pricing strategy.</p>
