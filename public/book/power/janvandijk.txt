Summary

- p2 power is the ability to shape events.
- p3 social vs natural vs technical power
- p3 dialectical view. technology is a mediator, tech and society influence one another
- pve: AI is now being trained on how AI is being used by humans. Which is better than AI being trained on whatever AI is generating.
- p12 feedback loops in power: natural power is used to get more power (chain reaction). Power to versus power over.
- p13 humans control natural power
- p14 digital infrastructures transform: make things possible that weren't before; automation of transformation. Control that is possible as a result of this. Tech introduces new stakeholders to the game (e.g. ultrasound, takes agency away from the pregnant woman), and shifts power.
- p16 preventing is also power
- p16 power always meets resistance and counterpower. Voorbeeld counterpower van buschauffeurs die gecontroleerd worden.
- p16 power is a capacity (of negatief bekeken: een dreigement is ook macht)
- p18 le pouvoir public
- p19 is technolgoy zelf ook een actor?
- p19 capacity van actoren, om te beinvloeden in een context teneinde ..
- p23 is power positive or negative?
- p24 game theory; political power comes from the barrel of a gun.
- p25 voorbeeld. providers dwingen gebruikers om voorwaarden te accepteren. Niet eens eenmalig, maar creeping up. Hier zit een prisoners dilemma in?
- p25 micro = humans, meso is groepen, instituties, macro is big tech en overheid. Ik denk zelf dat er verschil is onder en boven de 150 pax.
- p27 belemmeren van keuze is ook een verschijning van macht. Terwijl grotere keuze vaak als meer keuze wordt gepresenteerd, maar dat niet altijd is.
- p27 creators and users can have shifting foci of power
- p27 voorbeeld internet, wie is er de baas over? private, public? tegelijkertijd is internet een middel tot subversiviteit tegen de centrale machten. Als zodanig is het internet nauwelijks meer te controleren.
- p29 nudging is ook een vorm van macht.
- p30 technologie wordt van een tool van individuen tot een tool voor organisaties (denk polders en irrigatiesystemen)
- p31 ownership implies control (in hoeverre is dat zo)
- p44 tech means artifacts
- p45 tech implies skills, and in particular transferable (learnable) skills. If tech (a.o. AI) is an actor, it has a symbiotic relation with other actors (the skilled persons). Scalability shifts the power from the craftsmen to the capitalist who can bring together a: the scale, b: the investment for skills.
- p45 socially transmittable skills require language, or at least some form of shared common concepts (symbol making).
- p46 tools give power because they afford transformations, however this notion has critiques. e.g. it excludes morality.
- p47 it also does not talk about second order effects (not anticipated now) and third order effects (not anticipated for the future)
- p48 technology is an active mediator
- p64 actors: creators, makers, users
- p65 technology involves making choices within constraints. If you do X, you cannot do Y.
- p67 the invention of capitalism (voc?). Who rules the internet? big tech, or big gov?
- p78 mediation - introduction. 
- p81 technological determinism -> tech determines social change (diamat?)
- p81 does society use technology, or does technology use society (link: the selfish meme)
- p82 techno optimism: societal problems can be solved by tech
- p82 technology is a social construct - with a life of its own. SCT Social construction of Technology, Actor Network Theory
- p83 because one man has invented how to make a sword, the other has the have one too, even if you do not plan to use it. This implies that the sword itself has power, because it forces behaviour.
- p84 fallacy of lone inventor: all tech is a social construct.
- p85 ontwerp, versus productie versus gebruik. Met name bij sofware is productie niet langer een machtsfactor.
- p86 (link met text niet helemaal duidelijk) stabilisatie en closure versus cambrian explosion. Voorbeeld al die computer firma's: Prime, Harris, Electrologica, etc.
- p87 can technology be fully autonomous?
- p89 ANT shares Foucault's definition of power as the ability to affect the actions of others.
- p89 Karl Marx (following Hegel) historical materialism (Engels: dialectic materialism)
- p91 tech change => societal change? of andersom
- p92 bv. om nut te halen uit AI, moet je je gedrag aanpassen, en dat wordt weer een gewoonte
- p92 Winner, inherently political technologies (e.g. microtargeting)
- p95 dialectic: interaction and mediation (mediation requires 3rd party, e.g. technology, humans, nature.)
- p96 power is a relational affair
- p115 Human machine interface. interaction is a dance constrained by both parties
- p123 websites tunnel actions of users, by choice, timing or limited conceptual model. websites also enable (therefore empower the user)
- p125 social media (mediate) enable people to communicate, but also force that in a certain direction (rabbit hole, bubble, example: start with an anonymous new account in e.g. YT)
- p129 e.v. personal devices.
- p144 meso power. organizational change, flow of power top-down versus bottum up.
- p146 Conway's law. Ook mijn psychology paper. the case of devops.
- p148 technological determinism: tech drives org change. SCT: the organization chooses to deploy technology. dialectic: technology is the trigger, but it is not deterministic
- p148 if you select facilities of a technology, you have power over how the organisation uses tech.
- p150 large scale introduction of technology requires a power structure
- p158 Mintzberg's structures, who has power over technology in these 5 configurations (machine bureaucracy, division, professional, adhocracy, etc.)
- p163 Infocracy in organisations
- p165 subvert giving information, resistance, counter power. Story of busses and monitoring
- p166 effects of introducing technology 1. order: intended, 2. unintended 3. long term
- p167 resistance: indiv, collective or systemic
- p168 individual resistance: refusal, escape, voice, (counter)creation, incompetence.
- p178 technology itself forces activities. Technology is an actor itself (what technology wants) jacques ellul. 
- p181 the network society is both a social and a technical construction; also, internet was gov, then broken up.
- p181 the deal: we provide free use, we exploit your data (for ads, or for political objectives); NTS here is how the market corrupts politics
- p182 network effects, and 'vendor' lock-in to a network. e.g. telephony
- p183 capitalism fuels innovation, varying degrees of state involvement
- p183 however NASA and WWII show state driven innovation.
- p187 companies such as Meta and AWS control large parts of the society and become competitors to the state
- p187 authoritarian states control Big Tech, or Big Tech controls the state.
- p188 surveillance -> purposes of influence, protection or direction
- p189 surveillance can be resisted
- p193 information reduces uncertainty, and is therefore a source of power, in particular if it is asymetric
- p193 value of information, Monty Hall /Ruis game
- p194 who owns data? personal or otherwise
- p194 smart cities - who benefits?
- p195 is social media a telco or a publisher. This determines power and regulation
- p196 media society: all communications are mediated by technology (instead of around the village tree)
- p198 technocracy, what does it mean? 1. the experts (high priests) have the power, 2. technology is the power.
- p208 information is the reduction of uncertainty, but information processing is the reduction of information.
- p209 symbolic AI versus statistical/probabilistic
- p220 technology is created by humans, but then technology directs humans. A modern day box of Pandora
- p221 slave to the rythm -> slave to the algorithm
- p224 echo chambers
- p226 current situation. big power of big AI versus small power of individual consumers -> societal regulation
- p226 bundled powers. regulation, reputation, consumer advocay, class action
- p227 is the law an instrument of power, or is power an instrument of the law?
- p230 big AI tech may be doomed. So may models are out there, begin open weight, etc.
- p234 conclusion. Jan van Dijk has a dialectical view of technology. Mediation and interaction play a big role (NTS intermediairies)
- p235 power always meets counterpower.
- p243 every technology is human made. (we dont call animal inventions technology)
- p246 sleepwalking through innovations that we created ourselves
- p250 Collinridge dilemma. effects cannot be predicted until they appear. Governance therefore is too early, or too late.
