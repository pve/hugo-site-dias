<meta name="description" content="Podcasting has its own digital infrastructures, for example in hosting them.
Let&rsquo;s look at how podcasting has grown, and what made it take off anyway?
Many actors influence each other here, and the state of the art of the technology also has an impact on growth rates.
Suppose a hundred people get told by an enthusiastic friend to try podcasting.
Of these, ten don’t have any hardware on which they can play the podcasts.
So the rest goes online, and tries to find interesting content, but only 50 people can find a directory in which they can even start to look for podcasts that they like. Only 40 people then find content that they sufficiently like.
Ten people drop out because they find loading the content too complicated. Of these, another ten find out that the files are too big for the hardware they have (for example in 2005, they just had a simple MP3 player, no iPod or similar).
Of the ones left, another five don’t have the patience for the downloads (we are talking dial-up internet access for a lot of people here, still).
If you have been keeping tabs: we are down to 25 people who are capable and willing to regularly listen to podcasts. Now suppose each of these tells four friends, on the average. That means we are back to a hundred.">
