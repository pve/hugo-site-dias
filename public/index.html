    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Risk is the flip side of value. For everything that is of value, there can be circumstances threatening that value. While value is realized in the past and the present, risk is what can happen with that value in the future.
Risk in a digital world is not always easy to think through. While we can borrow a lot from the real world, certain important differences exist.
At the core of every risk assessment there is the thing we worry about the most: the ‘asset’. In a digital world, this is often the data. Think of business-critical data, like our database of customers. Think of data that we have a compliance obligation on, such as personal data.

    <p>Let’s dive a little deeper into assets. The most relevant asset in information security is data. That is what users of information care about most. In addition, we can also see the processing power that we need as an asset.
Here are some examples of data assets:
A customer record in a business system An MRI scan A browser cookie (on the server) A logfile entry As you can guess from these examples, many involve regulatory concerns due to the type of data that they consist of. One of the tasks of a risk analyst is to figure out what regulations apply exactly.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>My first interest in networking came in the early 80s, as I was in the final years of my mathematics and computer science master’s program.
At the time, dial-up terminal networking was about the most advanced there was. And if you were lucky, you’d get 1200 baud (transmitting approximately 120 characters per second). My current fiber-optic home links are 1 Gigabit/sec, which is about 1 million times faster.
Beyond this, computer-to-computer communication was mostly confined to the local data center. Transferring files from one computer to another typically involved physically moving storage media around. I have a great story about that, but that will be in another unit.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>What is information really? If we know that, we can try to understand how we can judge its value, or even start to understand how we can create value with information.
In Claude Shannon’s theory of communication, information is about reducing uncertainty. Another way is to say that more information means less noise because if you add noise to information, that information will have more uncertainty and less value.
To visualize this, think of a picture that is obscured by a bit of fog or haze. You can still see some of the picture, but not very clearly. You will make more errors when trying to understand what the picture means.

    <p>I have found that no discussion on risk is going to lead anywhere if it does not make clear who suffers from it. Make clear who has the pain. For my phone and laptop it is easy: if I lose them, I suffer. In a larger organization it is less clear. Suppose a server dies. Whose application then no longer runs? Who has to pay for a new server? This gets increasingly harder if we are talking about shared services, because the owner and the consumer are now decoupled.

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Introduction to Change and Control
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Change is quite inherent in technology, and in particular in information technology. At the same time we want technology to provide a reliable service, and that requires a degree of control. In this chapter we’ll explore some fundamentals of change, in particular how this works with groups of people.
Change and control mindsets complement each other. We need both, even if they conflict at times.
For example, in a typical IT environment, you have developers and system administrators. The output of the developers is a stream of changes: new features, improvements, bug fixes, and so on. Adminstrators are in the business of keeping everything stable, the same. They see no fundamental difference between a new feature and an incident. Both are disrupting the normal flow of business. Consequently, they are seen as a threat, and that is why it often feels that developers and system administrators are from different planets.

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Introduction to Power
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Power is a concept that is widely used and ill defined. Many philosophers have discussed it, but not one definition really stands out. Before we attempt to define power formally, let’s see how the word in used in everyday IT situations.
Understanding power in IT is not just academic. As the examples show it is crucial in understanding how IT works, and creates value and risk.
The cloud architect held significant power in deciding which platforms the organization would adopt for its digital transformation. Automated deployment pipelines gave development teams the power to release software faster and with fewer errors. Legacy systems often retain unexpected power in large organizations, simply because so many critical processes still depend on them. Regulators have the power to halt digital initiatives if data protection requirements are not met. By owning the central identity management service, the security team had the power to control access across the entire infrastructure. Outages at major cloud providers show how concentrated power in digital infrastructures can lead to systemic risk. The CIO used the power of budget approval to steer the enterprise toward adopting more secure infrastructure patterns. Power struggles between central IT and business units can delay the rollout of shared infrastructure services. With real-time observability tools, operations teams gained the power to detect and respond to incidents before users were affected. An open-source community can collectively wield more power than a single vendor when shaping the direction of a software tool. From these examples, we can see certain recurring features of power in the context of IT and digital infrastructures.
