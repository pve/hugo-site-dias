      <title>What certificate to pursue</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/ar-nov27-25/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A question I often get is &amp;ldquo;what certification or knowledge should I pursue to get me a better job?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or variants such as &amp;ldquo;which cert is going to get me employed?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my opinion on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certificates only bring you so far.
Most companies aren&amp;rsquo;t looking for people with knowledge.
They are looking for the results that the knowledge brings, such as improved processes, new revenue, etcetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s major innovations are in using generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Subject: When being a professional is not enough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have worked with many people who felt stuck in their professional lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often these were people having outstanding professional skills in cloud computing, security, IT architecture, artificial intelligence, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These also don&amp;rsquo;t lack ambition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, they feel unable to progress in the direction they want.
They have a strong feeling that they should be capable of more than what they achieve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(sent nov 11. How to make AI work for you)
By now, you probably had your first encounters with AI.
What did you run into? Would love to know about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am currently on a sabbatical, these things are top of mind for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I am focussing on two AI directions.
Given my background in cloud security, I cannot help but think about AI security and governance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>OWASP LLM Risk Allocation</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/projects/olra/olra/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Applications based on LLMs (Large Language Models) have risks too.
The &lt;a href=&#34;https://owasp.org/www-project-top-10-for-large-language-model-applications/&#34;&gt;OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications&lt;/a&gt; risks are a good start for analyzing the risks of such a system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of applications, like many others, are also cloud applications.
This means that there is a variety of parties responsible for controlling those risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, who is supposed to do each control? And which role do they have?
For example, there are model providers, there is the AI consumer, and so on.
For a deeper story on these roles look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/book/diginfra/ai-roles/&#34;&gt;AI roles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
