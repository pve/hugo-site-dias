      <title>Introduction to Risk</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/risk/intro-to-risk/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Risk is the flip side of value. For everything that is of value, there can be circumstances threatening that value.
While value is realized in the past and the present, risk is what can happen with that value in the &lt;em&gt;future&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk in a digital world is not always easy to think through. While we can borrow a lot from the real world, certain important differences exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of every risk assessment there is the thing we worry about the most: the &amp;lsquo;&lt;strong&gt;asset&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;.
In a digital world, this is often the &lt;strong&gt;data&lt;/strong&gt;. Think of business-critical data, like our database of customers. Think of data that we have a compliance obligation on, such as personal data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Information Security Assets</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/risk/assets/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s dive a little deeper into assets.
The most relevant asset in information security is data.
That is what users of information care about most.
In addition, we can also see the processing power that we need as an asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of data assets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A customer record in a business system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An MRI scan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A browser cookie (on the server)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A logfile entry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can guess from these examples, many involve regulatory concerns due to the type of data that they consist of.
One of the tasks of a risk analyst is to figure out what regulations apply exactly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Elements of the Digital World</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/diginfra/elements-of-digitalinfrastructures/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 20:34:01 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book/diginfra/elements-of-digitalinfrastructures/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It all starts with bits: digital units of information. It is about how we store these bits, how we move these bits, and how we transform or process these bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three major elements of digital infrastructures are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the cloud security world, it is customary to talk about data at rest, data in motion, and data in use. This introduces data as the key common element. But more on cloud security later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Can AI automate compliance?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/risk-value/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 14:37:11 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/risk-value/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My AI-supported risk analysis assistant mirrors a common pitfall in risk management: focusing on irrelevant controls rather than genuine threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have created a risk analyst AI based on industry best practices, or so I assume.
This is part of a quest toward more compliance automation, because as an industry we are falling behind in security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am running through a simple example of a chatbot that answers questions over a nonsensitive dataset.
The analyst dives deep into questions on all kinds of controls that, in my view, are quite irrelevant to the risk at the business level.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I Got Started in Computer Networks</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/diginfra/first-network/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 14:31:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book/diginfra/first-network/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first interest in networking came in the early 80s, as I was in the final years of my mathematics and computer science master&amp;rsquo;s program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, dial-up terminal networking was about the most advanced there was.
And if you were lucky, you&amp;rsquo;d get 1200 baud (transmitting approximately 120 characters per second).
My current fiber-optic home links are 1 Gigabit/sec, which is about 1 million times faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, computer-to-computer communication was mostly confined to the local data center.
Transferring files from one computer to another typically involved physically moving storage media around.
I have a great story about that, but that will be in another unit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Zero Trust Myths</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the problem with the image that Zero Trust based information security brings along?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you understand the principles, and they are not really difficult, it is obvious that only ZT can lead us to a more secure cyber future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is holding us back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the misconceptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is a boatload of work, so let&amp;rsquo;s not start.&amp;rdquo; Truth: yes, fully securing your IT with all its technical debt is a boatload of work. That is exactly the reason why you need ZT, so that you know where you can get started quickly, and be more secure &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the last hole is plugged.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The AI Coding Age</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-coding-age/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 13:13:09 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-coding-age/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the dawn of a new age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been observing software development for more than fifty years, ever since I wrote my first computer program.
In that entire time, I have never witnessed a development that has changed the profession deeper, faster, or more pervasively than now.
AI-assisted coding has escaped from the lab, and is impacting the work of every software developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the communities I track I hear stories of software engineers regret taking a single week of vacation because of the innovations that they now have to catch up to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Janvandijk</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/power/janvandijk/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 20:32:17 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book/power/janvandijk/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Summary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;p2 power is the ability to shape events.
p3 social vs natural vs technical power
p3 dialectical view. technology is a mediator, tech and society influence one another
pve: AI is now being trained on how AI is being used by humans. Which is better than AI being trained on whatever AI is generating.
p12 feedback loops in power: natural power is used to get more power (chain reaction). Power to versus power over.
p13 humans control natural power
p14 digital infrastructures transform: make things possible that weren&amp;rsquo;t before; automation of transformation. Control that is possible as a result of this. Tech introduces new stakeholders to the game (e.g. ultrasound, takes agency away from the pregnant woman), and shifts power.
p16 preventing is also power
p16 power always meets resistance and counterpower. Voorbeeld counterpower van buschauffeurs die gecontroleerd worden.
p16 power is a capacity (of negatief bekeken: een dreigement is ook macht)
p18 le pouvoir public
p19 is technolgoy zelf ook een actor?
p19 capacity van actoren, om te beinvloeden in een context teneinde ..
p23 is power positive or negative?
p24 game theory; political power comes from the barrel of a gun.
p25 voorbeeld. providers dwingen gebruikers om voorwaarden te accepteren. Niet eens eenmalig, maar creeping up. Hier zit een prisoners dilemma in?
p25 micro = humans, meso is groepen, instituties, macro is big tech en overheid. Ik denk zelf dat er verschil is onder en boven de 150 pax.
p27 belemmeren van keuze is ook een verschijning van macht. Terwijl grotere keuze vaak als meer keuze wordt gepresenteerd, maar dat niet altijd is.
p27 creators and users can have shifting foci of power
p27 voorbeeld internet, wie is er de baas over? private, public? tegelijkertijd is internet een middel tot subversiviteit tegen de centrale machten. Als zodanig is het internet nauweijiks meer te controleren.
p29 nudging is ook een vorm van macht.
p30 technologie wordt van een tool van individuen tot een tool voor organisaties (denk polders en irrigatiesystemen)
p31 ownership implies control (in hoeverre is dat zo)
p44 tech means artifacts
p45 tech implies skills, and in particular transferable (learnable) skills. If tech (a.o. AI) is an actor, it has a symbiotic relation with other actors (the skilled persons). Scalability shifts the power from the craftsmen to the capitalist who can bring together a: the scale, b: the investment for skills.
p45 socially transmittable skills require language, or at least some form of shared common concepts (symbol making).
p46 tools give power because they afford transformations, however this notion has critiques. e.g. it excludes morality.
p47 it also does not talk about second order effects (not anticipated now) and third order effects (not anticipated for the future)
p48 technology is an active mediator
p64 actors: creators, makers, users
p65 technology involves making choices within constraints. If you do X, you cannot do Y.
p67 the invention of capitalism (voc?). Who rules the internet? big tech, or big gov?
p78 mediation - introduction
p81 technological determinism -&amp;gt; tech determines social change (diamat?)
p81 does society use technology, or does technology use society (link: the selfish meme)
p92 techno optimism: societal problems can be solved by tech
p92 technology is a social construct - with a life of its own
p93 because one man has invented how to make a sword, the other has the have one too, even if you do not plan to use it. This implies that the sword itself has power, because it forces behaviour.
p84 fallacy of lone inventor: all tech is a social construct.
p85 ontwerp, versus productie versus gebruik. Met name bij sofware is productie niet langer een machtsfactor.
p86 (link met text niet helemaal duidelijk) stabilisatie en closure versus cambrian explosion. Voorbeeld al die computer firma&amp;rsquo;s: Prime, Harris, Electrologica, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>AI will replace coders, not software engineers</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-code-software/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 12:45:13 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/ai-code-software/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you build software for a living, generative AI may be a scary development, as it has the potential to take over a lot of software creation.
But I think it depends on what you see as the job of creating software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A coder in the world of IT is somebody who writes code in some programming language.
More typically they modify code instead of writing it from scratch.
This is in response to bugs, feature requests, and so on.
In the age of AI, a lot of coding can be automated.
We have seen many examples of AI generating lots of code based on fairly compact specifications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is the story of how I started to use AI to help with running and securing my home network.
I call it vibe ops, in analogy to vibe programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is going to be obsolete very soon, even though it is already the second version &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My home network plays an additional role as a nice lab, and in the process of better securing it, preferably with Zero Trust Architectures, I am doing some experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why You Should Read this Book</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/diginfra/why-you-should-read/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 08:47:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book/diginfra/why-you-should-read/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You should not read this book because I tell you to.
After all, you are an autonomous person, making your own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should read this book because you are convinced that it is likely to give you significant insights into a world that matters to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital infrastructures, and information technology at large, have moved from a fringe niche technology to becoming an essential part of modern life.
Most companies would go belly up in weeks, if not days, if their digital infrastructures would fail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is the value of information?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/value/value-of-information/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 May 2025 11:33:28 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book/value/value-of-information/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is information really?
If we know that, we can try to understand how we can judge its value, or even start to understand how we can create value with information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Claude Shannon&amp;rsquo;s theory of communication, information is about reducing uncertainty.
Another way is to say that more information means less noise because if you add noise to information, that information will have more uncertainty and less value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To visualize this, think of a picture that is obscured by a bit of fog or haze.
You can still see some of the picture, but not very clearly.
You will make more errors when trying to understand what the picture means.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Three books on Zero Trust, and when you should read them</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/three-books-zero-trust/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 12:46:33 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/three-books-zero-trust/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;But where do we start?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question hung in the air of my training session, asked by many of the attendants. Mind you, these are experienced people with many years of cyber security experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But turning Zero Trust from an abstract concept into concrete action? That&amp;rsquo;s where everyone gets stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that feeling well. Years ago, I joined my first Zero Trust working group, swimming in a sea of frameworks, agency guidelines, and vendor whitepapers. I even had the privilege of attending sessions with John Kindervag, the father of Zero Trust himself. Yet the gap between theory and implementation remained stubbornly wide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Saas Security: a Simple Checklist</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/saas-security-simple-checklist/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 10:56:37 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/saas-security-simple-checklist/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The security of your SaaS cloud solutions starts with the review of three major areas. Practically all companies are using SaaS providers in one way or another.
SaaS includes Services such as Trello for project management, Microsoft 365, and e.g. specialized solutions for marketing intelligence services. The sky is the limit. Most companies using are using hundreds of SaaS solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are 3 tips to start with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;maturity-match&#34;&gt;Maturity match&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to worry about is if the maturity of the provider matches your risk appetite. Are they good enough for your use case?
If you are working with a mission-critical SaaS solution, you want to make sure that the provider is mature. You can start finding out if that is the case is by looking at their certifications. An example could be the ISO 27000 series certification for IT risk management, or similar. Most mature cloud providers have dozens of certifications. On the other end of the spectrum, you may want to work with a provider that is not so mature, but that is delivering a very innovative solution of great business benefit to your company. That benefit, that competitive edge, may warrant a greater risk appetite.
So start with that maturity match first.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Great Introduction to Zero Trust</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 10:48:42 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/great-introduction-to-zero-trust/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Project Zero Trust” is a business novel by George Finney. It talks about an emerging approach to IT and Cybersecurity that attempts to reduce cyberrisk in a more fundamental way.
Zero Trust is a bit of a hype in IT these days, and both product companies and knowledge agencies are dropping lots of papers on this. But this book is in another game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I like about it is that it paints a reasonably realistic picture of a modern enterprise, including the information technology choices that it makes. This serves as a good backdrop to a variety of Zero Trust initiatives, which are described in a bit of detail.
As an instructor I find that most of the vendor neutral training material out there lacks specific examples. This makes it hard for students to anchor the abstract concepts that they are fed to a realistic environment with some resemblance to their job situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Key Knowledge Gaps in Cloud Security and How to Address Them</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/key-knowledge-gaps-in-cloud-security/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2025 07:41:35 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/key-knowledge-gaps-in-cloud-security/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What are the real challenges in cloud security these days? In my recent conversations with industry practitioners, one came up consistently: the lack of knowledge and skills to adopt cloud securely.
These gaps are slowing down how teams build, manage and secure their cloud environments, and they may be affecting your teams as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;provider-specific-technical-expertise&#34;&gt;Provider specific technical expertise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many IT professionals attempt to transfer their on-premises security knowledge directly to cloud. But this often leads to ineffective and hard to maintain solutions.
A technical example is insisting on traditional firewall architectures. These are hard to implement right in the cloud and can lead to less secure deployments than are possible with cloud native architectures.
One set of skills that is relevant to addressing this is understanding what features a specific cloud provider has for building a secure architecture. There are many courses available from the providers, even free ones, though it can sometimes be a bit challenging to select the correct ones.
However, without understanding how abstraction and automation change the IT security game, these technical skills will not result in more efficiency. And without more efficiency security efforts will be outpaced by the speed of new developments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Look at MCP now to be ahead of AI risk</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/mcp-risk/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/mcp-risk/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are in security and not fully on top of AI risk, you want to look at MCP &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt;, as this is going to be popular and risky.
Reach out to your development teams and beyond to offer your help in using them wisely, even if you know nothing about them yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MCP, Model Context Protocol, was introduced in November 2024 as a standardised way to feed AI chatbots with extra information.
You can extend Claude or OpenAI desktop with MCP servers, which are basically small programs that run on the desktop and have access to all information and services that the user has.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have found that no discussion on risk is going to lead anywhere if it does not make clear who suffers from it.
Make clear who has the pain.
For my phone and laptop it is easy: if I lose them, I suffer.
In a larger organization it is less clear.
Suppose a server dies.
Whose application then no longer runs?
Who has to pay for a new server?
This gets increasingly harder if we are talking about shared services, because the owner and the consumer are now decoupled.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How does vibe coding work in the real? Vibe coding is having AI write your software. Coined by Andrej Karpathy, the hype is all over the map, with companies that are rethinking their hiring strategies for programmers. Sounds like disaster for software engineers and programmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not so fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious to learn more about it, I reached out to an old friend who is an experienced software engineer. He was a co-founder in a SaaS company in the monitoring space. After a successful exit he now has a bit more time to pursue hobbies. But he is still professionally busy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introduction to Change and Control</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/change/intro-to-change-control/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2025 09:17:02 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Change is quite inherent in technology, and in particular in information technology.
At the same time we want technology to provide a reliable service, and that requires a degree of control.
In this chapter we&amp;rsquo;ll explore some fundamentals of change, in particular how this works with groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change and control mindsets complement each other.
We need both, even if they conflict at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in a typical IT environment, you have developers and system administrators.
The output of the developers is a stream of changes: new features, improvements, bug fixes, and so on.
Adminstrators are in the business of keeping everything stable, the same.
They see no fundamental difference between a new feature and an incident. Both are disrupting the normal flow of business. Consequently, they are seen as a threat, and that is why it often feels that developers and system administrators are from different planets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introduction to Power</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/power/intro-power/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 12:31:46 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book/power/intro-power/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Power is a concept that is widely used and ill defined. Many philosophers have discussed it, but not one definition really stands out.
Before we attempt to define power formally, let&amp;rsquo;s see how the word in used in everyday IT situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding power in IT is not just academic. As the examples show it is crucial in understanding how IT works, and creates value and risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cloud architect held significant power in deciding which platforms the organization would adopt for its digital transformation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automated deployment pipelines gave development teams the power to release software faster and with fewer errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legacy systems often retain unexpected power in large organizations, simply because so many critical processes still depend on them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulators have the power to halt digital initiatives if data protection requirements are not met.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By owning the central identity management service, the security team had the power to control access across the entire infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outages at major cloud providers show how concentrated power in digital infrastructures can lead to systemic risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CIO used the power of budget approval to steer the enterprise toward adopting more secure infrastructure patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power struggles between central IT and business units can delay the rollout of shared infrastructure services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With real-time observability tools, operations teams gained the power to detect and respond to incidents before users were affected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An open-source community can collectively wield more power than a single vendor when shaping the direction of a software tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these examples, we can see certain recurring features of power in the context of IT and digital infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Value in Process Improvement</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most digital infrastructures are meant to communicate or coordinate, or are in support of other digital infrastructures that communicate or coordinate.
That is where their prime value is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet is a great example. It is designed to enable computers to communicate by moving data packets between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media is another example, used by people to communicate with each other. Its success is a testament to the fact that communication is a fundamental human need.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Promise Theory</title>

      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 21:21:54 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book/diginfra/promise-theory/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Digital infrastructures focus on services rather than products, making it elusive to capture the essence of these services, especially in defining the fluid interactions between service providers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promise theory is a little-known approach to interaction, though it has quite a few great thinkers behind it.
Introduced by Mark Burgess and others, it is about how autonomous agents work together.
It helped me a lot in getting a handle on various distributed systems.
There was this project where we designed a scalable travel information system with what we now call microservices.
We needed to describe how these parts work together.
And there was a project that required lots of independent and autonomous social security agencies to work together on providing a service.
In getting this from the drawing board to actual production, promise theory turned out to be a great tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The moral necessity of talking about power</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/power/ethics-of-power/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 20:30:57 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book/power/ethics-of-power/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For many people, the word power has a negative connotation.
They&amp;rsquo;d rather avoid using power altogether.
I can feel that, and I can definitely feel that about the abuse of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But does that make it unethical to talk about power?
Power is everywhere, and conflict too. There is no society without a power structure.
There are always differences of opinions in any group, if only to decide when to have lunch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Automation Business Case</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/value/automation-business-case/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Jul 2025 06:51:53 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book/value/automation-business-case/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Automation is a big part of IT, but not all automation brings value.
Automation takes time and effort, upfront, and any benefits come later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the IT projects you were involved in, most of those aimed at providing a measurable benefit somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This diagram (from xkcd, a series of webcomics) illustrates when automating repetitive tasks, or even just parts of them, brings benefit.
In other words, is there a &lt;em&gt;business case&lt;/em&gt; for such an intervention?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Control Through Feedback Loops</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/change/control-feedback/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book/change/control-feedback/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to influence and control a system, but one of the most controlled (pun intended) ways is to use feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with an analogy first: driving a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want the car to stop as fast as possible, it suffices to push the brakes as hard as you can. But that does not give you much control.
For example, your passengers might not like it, and it leads to wear on the tires.
If you want the car to stop at an intended location, for example just in front of a traffic light, you apply a feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Contracts are complementary promises</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/diginfra/promise-contract/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 21:03:24 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book/diginfra/promise-contract/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once we understand promises, contracts between agents now become really simple to express.
They are a set of complementary conditional promises: &amp;ldquo;If you do this, I will promise that&amp;rdquo;.
In our example this looks like the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you promise to pay me, I will promise to bring you coffee.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you promise to bring me coffee, I will promise to pay you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one party does not keep its end of the bargain, the other party is free to withdraw from their part of the deal.
Of course there is the complication that somebody has to deliver first: do you get coffee first, or do you have to pay first?
This requires trust.
As you are probably aware, both types of contract exist in real life.
In fact you can find more complicated versions as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shared Services Lead to Conflicts</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/diginfra/shared-service-conflict/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Digital infrastructures serve, nearly always, multiple customers.
These customers therefore share the resources provided by these digital infrastructures.
With that sharing comes the potential for conflicts over those resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I talk to my friend over the phone, we share a connection, and that is exactly when sharing is part of the value of that infrastructure.
But when multiple users draw computer capacity from the same pool, there is a risk that the pool is too small, and some users will not get the capacity that they require.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;what other assets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where did that file go?
Where did you leave that address?
Who changed your password?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have assets and risks identified, we think of ways to minimize these risks.
Those ways are called controls or measures.
If you have read through an IT risk management book, many of these should be familiar.
For the rest of you, here is a brief outline of some control examples for data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Things Break at Scale</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/diginfra/things-break-at-scale/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Apr 2025 21:16:12 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Computers are terribly reliable, in general. Today&amp;rsquo;s computer systems execute millions, even trillions, of instructions each second, with an error rate that is inconceivable in other technologies. Yet, if you have hundreds of thousands of machines, you do need to take care of failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days of Google growth I read an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnet.com/culture/google-spotlights-data-center-inner-workings/&#34;&gt;article about their error numbers&lt;/a&gt;
(a Google cluster has several thousands of machines):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each cluster&amp;rsquo;s first year, it&amp;rsquo;s typical that 1,000 individual machine failures will occur; thousands of hard drive failures will occur; one power distribution unit will fail, bringing down 500 to 1,000 machines for about 6 hours; 20 racks will fail, each time causing 40 to 80 machines to vanish from the network; 5 racks will &amp;ldquo;go wonky,&amp;rdquo; with half their network packets missing in action; and the cluster will have to be rewired once, affecting 5 percent of the machines at any given moment over a 2-day span, Dean said. And there&amp;rsquo;s about a 50 percent chance that the cluster will overheat, taking down most of the servers in less than 5 minutes and taking 1 to 2 days to recover.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Essence of Digital Infrastructures</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/diginfra/essence-digital-infrastructures/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What do roads, airports, the internet, the electricity network, and a search engine have in common? They are all services that are independent of a specific user or usage. They are provisioned on a longer timescale than that of an individual usage. And they are typically not owned by their users, or at least, not directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book I am mostly concerned with digital infrastructures. Their services are digitally accessible. Of the above examples, the internet and the search engine are the best examples of that. Interestingly, the other services increasingly rely on digital infrastructures themselves, or even incorporate specific digital infrastructures.
Trading platforms, for example, enable the planning of electricity supply and demand.
In many countries, electricity is a market, not a monopoly, which requires coordination between the various players.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What about AI Risks?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While Artificial Intelligence, especially the generative type, is a highly disruptive form of IT innovation, its risk management still follows the same basic principles.
We just need to extend those principles to new forms of data and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the assets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the vulnerabilities and threats to it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the damage that this can bring, realistically?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s see how what the AI specifics are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-assets&#34;&gt;AI Assets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s focus on the AI assets that are the product of deep learning.
Deep learning neural networks have represented a shift in AI technology.
Before that, symbolic AI was more common.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How to fix the WiFi? How to find a new phone for grandma?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying technology follows certain rules. However, many people only have an intuitive understanding of these rules. As a result, technology is not optimally applied.
By understanding how applying technology really works, you can be more effective, more efficient, reduce waste, and overall do a better job. It takes just a few simple steps to improve any attempt at applying technology. We&amp;rsquo;ll focus on information technology here, though most principles have wider applicability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Consumers of digital infrastructures benefit from not running them themselves, but having a provider who serves more consumers do it for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine stringing a wire to connect your PC to your neighbor&amp;rsquo;s PC in order to play a game together. People have been doing these things. How long does it take to string the wires and connect them? What is the cost? Where do you buy the cable? How are you going to run that cable? It is a lot faster to just use the internet for that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shared resources can lead to conflicts.
If the capacity runs out, somebody will feel the pain at the expense of somebody else.
This conflict will be resolved in one way or another.
Without other arrangements, the stakeholder with the most power wins.
This is not necessarily the best outcome for the organization as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this, I gave ChatGPT the following prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a business case story about the conflict over shared computing resources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Where the buck stops</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book/power/buck-stops/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The US president Harry S. Truman famously had a sign on his desk that said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buck stops here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This refers to the process of &amp;ldquo;passing up the buck&amp;rdquo;, meaning to escalate decisions to the next higher level in the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truman implied that he took responsibility but also that this is where power comes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an essential part of governance, and this vertical line of responsibility represents one way of looking at it.
We can trace how this works in the following risk management example.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Trust is an essential element in any collaboration.
We want to trust things, people, and organizations to do the right thing, to keep their promises.
Without trust, we will not be able to have confidence in the contribution of others, and that is a risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything we don&amp;rsquo;t trust is a risk.
Anytime we assume trust that is not warranted is also a risk.
That is one of the core concepts of Zero Trust Security Architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2005 I visited my father in France. It turned out to be convenient to pick me up from the Gerona airport in Spain.
And as we had enough time, we had lunch in La Jonquera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the restaurant&amp;rsquo;s checkout I noticed a peculiar array of devices: there were four payment terminals.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Positions of Power in IT</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book/power/positions-of-power-it/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the key aspirations of Digital Infrastructures at Scale is to equip you with the tools to shape and drive change in your professional environment—especially when your goal is to lead a transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every stakeholder has power. Here I want to highlight two important positions of influence in IT where technology meets power are architects and auditors/assessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT architects are builders. They design new applications, platforms, and infrastructures that enable businesses to operate more effectively. A CRM system, for example, is not just a technical solution—it transforms workflows, communication, and decision-making. Similarly, infrastructure architects create digital foundations that accelerate the deployment of such applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An application is roughly a data model plus a certain number of functions operating on that.
Networked applications typically live on servers, but will have a client component.
A word processor is an application. Its data model is formatted text, and the functionality allows you to manipulate that text.
Another example would be gmail, whose data model is a set of messages, and the functionality allows you to manipulate the messages and their flow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Power does not automatically flow from those that have it to those that are influenced by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they say in dutch, quoting the poet Willem Elsschot: &amp;ldquo;tussen droom en daad staan wetten in de weg, en praktische bezwaren&amp;rdquo;. (&amp;ldquo;between dream and deed stand laws in the way, and practical objections&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to understand this. If we want to exercise power, we need to understand the intermediaries. If we want to subvert power, the intermediaries are one of our disruptive points.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What do a laptop, a smartphone, and a smart thermostat have in common with a browser, a database, and a data center?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are all execution environments that contain software and data, and that makes them building blocks for deploying digital infrastructures.
In a diagram we often depict them as a box, or an oval.
Inside the box, software gets executed, instructions get interpreted, actions are done. Software without execution is just dead data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Getting to value quickly has value in itself.
The faster you get to value, the better it is, generally.
We&amp;rsquo;ll discuss some of the reasons for that elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agile development&lt;/strong&gt; is all the fashion nowadays for getting to digital value quickly.
Why is that and what kind of digital infrastructures does that require?
Back in the old days, business software was primarily written to automate &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;existing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; business processes. Those processes might change somewhat as a result, but in the core processes were no different. Think accounting systems, scheduling, &amp;ldquo;customer relationship management&amp;rdquo; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the moment a security vulnerability is discovered, it represents a negative value to its potential victims.
When it gets exploited, it can lead to loss of data or loss of integrity of the data.
This in turn impacts the victim&amp;rsquo;s business processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if personal data is leaked, reputations will be damaged, financial losses and fines can be expected. Credit card abuse forms another example of loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &amp;ldquo;damage potential&amp;rdquo; increases as the vulnerability becomes well-known, progressing from nation state actors, to organized crime, to script kiddies, just to name one example pathway.
At first, few people know about it, but gradually more people will be able to inflict damage with it.
Over time, each step adds to the likelihood of that vulnerability being exploited and causing real damage.
The likelihood starts at near zero, and ends at close to 100% as the vulnerability is completely public.
This only stops when an investment is made to mitigate the vulnerability, for example by updating the software.
And hopefully, that investment is less costly than the damage potential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Network Management Automation - the DHCP case</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we mature processes, they come within reach of actual automation. Especially IT management processes. To paraphrase General Carl von Clausewitz, who said &amp;ldquo;War is the continuation of diplomacy with different means&amp;rdquo;, we can say that automation is the progression of process maturity with different means - replacing human effort with software and systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite historical example is IP address allocation. In the past, whenever there was a new computer, you would walk up to the head of the lab or data center and ask for a new IP address for that machine. You may remember that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Business Model Canvas for IaaS Providers</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/value/business-model-canvas-iaas/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;business-model-canvas&#34;&gt;Business Model Canvas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management tool that serves as a visual framework for developing and discussing business models.
For additional information, see &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas&#34;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business model canvas has nine basic building blocks. These define the interconnections and relationships within a business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example used in this section is Amazon Web Services (AWS), particularly EC2 (virtual machines on demand). This is an Infrastructure as a Service offering. The power of the business model canvas approach becomes clear when we see how it can distinguish between various cloud service offerings.

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book/change/new-skills-needed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the technical architecture of digital infrastructures is critically important, in particular for &lt;em&gt;non-technical&lt;/em&gt; professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have spent more than a decade educating people on cloud security, for example through certifications such as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/ccsk/&#34;&gt;Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge (CCSK)&lt;/a&gt;, organized by the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.clubcloudcomputing.com/ccsp/&#34;&gt;Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP)&lt;/a&gt;, as organized by (ISC)2.
These bodies of knowledge cover a lot of ground, and most of it is related to digital infrastructures at scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deployment is everything that happens between writing software and actually using that software by its intended users. And as we get more software and more users, deployment becomes more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-deployment-diagrams&#34;&gt;Why deployment diagrams?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployment diagrams are a great technique for communicating about important decisions in deploying software. Decisions such as who is going to do what, how are things connected, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to draw deployment diagrams and many standards to choose from. UML and Archimate are just a few of them. To me, there is no single right way to create deployment diagrams. In that sense, these diagrams are more like maps. And the usefulness of a map depends on the journey that you are going to make. A map for a mountain walk is pretty useless if you want to make a railroad journey and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The AI landscape has many digital infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s explain this step by step and focus on which data is stored where, and how it is processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A core element of AI systems is a trained model. At least that is true for the dominant AI form these days: deep learning neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trained model is the result of processing a lot of training data by a specific neural network. These models are fixed in size, but typically very big. The smallest useful models are close to a Gigabyte, while recent public chat models run into multiple Terabytes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Business Model Canvas for SaaS Providers</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book/value/business-model-canvas-saas/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a high-level overview of the SaaS provider business model and some of the strategic options that are in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;business-model-canvas&#34;&gt;Business Model Canvas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this unit, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore examples using two hypothetical SaaS providers: one offering bookkeeping software and the other a project collaboration platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;SaaS Cloud Canvas&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/book/value/business-model-canvas-saas/BusinessCanvasSaaS.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;customer-segments-cs&#34;&gt;Customer segments (CS)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Business Model Canvas, “Customer Segments” are the groups of customers that the company ultimately serves, I.e. the ones that consume and pay for the services.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Who made podcasting big?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/power/the-tipping-point-for-podcasting/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2005 13:35:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book/power/the-tipping-point-for-podcasting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Podcasting has its own digital infrastructures, for example in hosting them.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look at how podcasting has grown, and what made it take off anyway?
Many actors influence each other here, and the state of the art of the technology also has an impact on growth rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose a hundred people get told by an enthusiastic friend to try podcasting.
Of these, ten don’t have any hardware on which they can play the podcasts.
So the rest goes online, and tries to find interesting content, but only 50 people can find a directory in which they can even start to look for podcasts that they like. Only 40 people then find content that they sufficiently like.
Ten people drop out because they find loading the content too complicated. Of these, another ten find out that the files are too big for the hardware they have (for example in 2005, they just had a simple MP3 player, no iPod or similar).
Of the ones left, another five don’t have the patience for the downloads (we are talking dial-up internet access for a lot of people here, still).
If you have been keeping tabs: we are down to 25 people who are capable and willing to regularly listen to podcasts. Now suppose each of these tells four friends, on the average. That means we are back to a hundred.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Retrofitting Zero Trust on an existing application: an illustration</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book/risk/retrofitting-zero-trust-existing-application/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zero Trust Architecture is an approach to better cybersecurity. To many, it seems daunting to implement. But it does not have to be hard to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this hypothetical situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have an application with hundreds of thousands of sensitive records, let’s say client records. We assume that in this example it seems hard to implement MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) on it. What other controls can you implement to reduce the assumed trust? We can use the Kipling method, which is at the core of Zero Trust architectures, to engineer better controls. In short, the Kipling method is about the &amp;lsquo;who&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;what&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;when&amp;rsquo;, etcetera of allowed communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Multiple Ways to Go Cloud</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book/value/three-ways-to-go-cloud/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Public cloud migrations come in different shapes and sizes, but I see three major approaches. Each of these brings value in its own way, and they all have very different technical and governance implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;three-approaches&#34;&gt;Three approaches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies dying to get rid of their data centers often get started on a &lt;strong&gt;‘lift and shift’&lt;/strong&gt; approach, where applications are moved from existing servers to equivalent servers in the cloud. The cloud service model consumed here is mainly IaaS (infrastructure as a service). Not much is outsourced to cloud providers here. Contrast that with SaaS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why lawyers need to understand cloud</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/change/lawyers-need-understand-tech/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/book/change/lawyers-need-understand-tech/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cloud is too important to leave to technical people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud distributes responsibility for IT services across an IT supply chain. This supply chain is composed of independent providers. This implies that there are these companies have &lt;strong&gt;technical boundaries&lt;/strong&gt; that are matched by organizational and &lt;strong&gt;contractual boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;. This is new, we did not have that before the digital revolution.
Amazon calls this the &lt;strong&gt;shared&lt;/strong&gt; responsibility model for cloud security.
I would simplify that as:  &lt;em&gt;what do I do, and what do you do&lt;/em&gt;? For example, who is responsible for patching the Operating System in an IaaS service model?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I have worked with many organizations, large and small.
In one case, I implemented the exact same change in more than 15 organizations, whose size ranged from 35 to 35 thousand employees.
You can imagine that this plays out differently across these organizations.
But that is a story for another unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It led me to see patterns in decision making and trust.
Who takes decisions in an organization?
How do people even talk about decisions, especially when they concern digital technology?
Who do you trust?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Customer service is a great thinking model for a lot of what is going on in digital infrastructures, even if the customer is not a human, as we will see.
We are often buying products, but we really mostly want a service.

Here we&amp;rsquo;ll embed them in a unified framework that illustrates how they fit together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the title of this book you can see that the main pillars of that framework include value, power, and risk.
To get there, we need a fourth pillar: change.
For now, we&amp;rsquo;ll call these pillars layers, though there is no implied hierarchy between them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Technologies are often called disruptive.
But what makes a technology truly disruptive?
What has made the PC a disruptive technology? Or artificial intelligence, for that matter?
And at what time did it become a disruptive technology?
While many would accept that AI was a very disruptive technology starting from 2022 onwards,
most of it was available much earlier. GenAI, chatbots, etc.
Think of ELIZA, the 60s era psychology chatbot by Joseph Weizenbaum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/autonomie-van-bigtech/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Het nationale sentiment is negatief over de afhankelijkheid van &amp;lsquo;big tech&amp;rsquo;. Overheidsdata staat in een Amerikaanse cloud, we hebben geen eigen sociaal netwerk, enzovoort. En vergelijkbare sentimenten spelen bij andere organisaties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terecht wordt daarom nu op overheidsniveau een initiatief in gang gezet om wat aan die afhankelijkheid te doen. Dit initiatief staat ook bekend als &lt;a href=&#34;https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/cloud-kootwijk-moties-aangenomen/&#34;&gt;Cloud Kootwijk&lt;/a&gt;. Maar met een motie in de Kamer zijn we er nog niet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emoties zijn vaak een goede indicator, maar geen goede inhoudelijke analyse.
Ze leiden daarom nog wel eens tot beslissingen die onhandig, of zelfs contraproductief uitpakken. Hier legt de emotie wantrouwen bloot, maar waar die zich op richt moet een analyse uitwijzen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I should have acted on the first signals more aggressively. But let’s talk about that later in this story.
Here is the story of my site being infected with malware, viewed by a professional cloud security expert. So I am going to apply all that cloud security theory to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hack led to business damage at the end of one of my webinars. In 2016, on a Friday, I did a webinar, at the end of which I had two links to my site as a call to action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;five-elements-of-cloud-security&#34;&gt;Five elements of cloud security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, IT security started with &lt;strong&gt;infrastructure security&lt;/strong&gt;. Just protecting the data center was good enough. But that was before we had data communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When data started to escape the confines of the data center we needed to protect it. Typically through encryption. Hence we need &lt;strong&gt;data security&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the world wide web developed, we saw applications being exposed to it, and frankly, be vulnerable. So that is when &lt;strong&gt;application security&lt;/strong&gt; started to become more important.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How AI Can Help IT Risk Classification</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How cool would it be to let an AI do some of the grunt work in analyzing the risk of applications and services. This has the potential to speed up the work of risk assessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, does it work in practice? Well, here is an example of AI-assisted risk classification. I downloaded some of the entries in the Dutch &lt;a href=&#34;https://algoritmes.overheid.nl/en&#34;&gt;algorithm register&lt;/a&gt;, which is a public register of systems that use algorithms. For each entry about 30 fields are available, including name, classification, owner, et cetera.
Some of the systems in the registry are AI-based. Indeed, we have AI to help check on AI&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The international arena has many actors that can influence digital infrastructures. But opinions differ on what the important ones are, or even what the relevant ones are.
But the international arena matters, because
by the nature of scaling, very few digital infrastructures are influenced by a single national actor only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A word of clarification: I am using the word international here to mean all nations in the world, and their interrelations.
In US vernacular, the word international appears to mean all nations, except the US.
Instead, the word global is used to mean all nations, including the US.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The US Air Force Zero Trust Strategy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who is really doing Zero Trust?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the US Air Force is. Here is my summary, with some comments, of their strategy document for the benefit of my Certificate of Competence in Zero Trust (CCZT) learners. In fact, this is an edited version of a conversation we had during one of our classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the full strategy &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dafcio.af.mil/Portals/64/Documents/Strategy/DAF%20API%20Reference%20Architecture%202.0.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the current roadmap &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dafcio.af.mil/Portals/64/Documents/Strategy/DAF%20Enterprise%20Zero%20Trust%20Roadmap%20and%20Release%20Notes_v2.0.pdf?ver=36cbAKNEe7JiRVAPFwWepg%3d%3d&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, all linked from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dafcio.af.mil/&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the fundamental first important point about the strategy document is that it exists at all. There is an actual organization of significant size that has a strategy and is implementing it. Many can learn from this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;In the Netherlands, we are currently engaged in a heated debate about the undesirable dominance of big tech, particularly over a significant portion of the digital infrastructure of the Dutch government. This includes email, file storage, and many other forms of digital storage and processing—most of which are handled by American big tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure a similar debate is going on in many other countries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Deployment diagrams for network security; fix this</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/network-diagram-fix/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/network-diagram-fix/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while back, I introduced my take on deployment diagrams for cloud and devops infrastructure. Some of the big points there are: it starts with intuitive drawings. Many people draw these things in similar ways, even without them having formal training.
In fact, formal training in architecture diagrams will not necessarily make those drawings easier to understand for the uninitiated.
But still. There are good drawings and there are drawings that can be improved.
My other big point is that deployment diagrams can be a great tool for security analysis. I am in some conversations with friends at banks who use them.
Recently I ran into the following example. Here is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://syang.substack.com/p/security-group-and-network-acl-in&#34;&gt;explanation of the difference between VPC and security groups&lt;/a&gt;. Great story, but I have some comments on the diagram, which used to come &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Security.html&#34;&gt;from AWS itself&lt;/a&gt;, by the way, but has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Small Example of Cloud Native Development</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cloud-native software development enables new practices. But it also requires them. It is a new level of working. However, putting all these new practices together requires integrating a lot of pieces.
To illustrate this new approach, I have started to develop a minimal application. Although minimal, I run it in production. Its basic function is to regularly pull out data from an air quality sensor into a cloud-based database. Together it is a few hundred lines of code.
Here are the major features of the example:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Top 8 cloud risks according to ENISA</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/top-8-cloud-risks-according-to-enisa/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2015 09:22:07 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/top-8-cloud-risks-according-to-enisa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Does security in the cloud ever bother you? It would be weird if it didn’t. Cloud computing has a lot of benefits, but also a lot of risks if done in the wrong way.
So what are the most important risks? The European Network Information Security Agency did extensive research on that in 2009 already, and identified 35 risk categories. This analysis is used by a number of players in the industry, including certain banking regulators. From those 35, ENISA has selected 8 as the most relevant ones. This article explains them, not in any particular order. (And by the way: ENISA is pronounced as ‘eniesa’, not ‘enaiza’).
You can also get the story on my YouTube video.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Controlling Cloud Sprawl in 2012</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Even in a cloud world, reducing server count is a lofty goal in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, you would be paying for all those servers anyway. Understand that sticking all your servers in a private cloud makes them more flexible, but not necessarily more efficient or cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2012 I did an interview with a guy who has a full time job in keeping those server counts down. Ron Kaminski is a capacity planner at Kimberly Clark Corporation (KCC). This interview is a composite of several conversations I had with Ron at the annual Computer Measurement Group (CMG) conferences, and a number of messages Ron wrote.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Directories are also infrastructures</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/directories-are-also-infrastructures/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the big projects I am working on right now (2006) is directory services for identity management. In these directories digital identities such as loginnames, addresses, access rights, etc. are stored. With an adequately structured directory service, the proper management of access rights becomes a lot easier, which translates into cost savings and better security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of these include the internet&amp;rsquo;s Domain Name System (DNS) and Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Active Directory. A lot of organizations however, have requirements beyond these systems, and for these a wide range of custom solutions are used.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Network Neutrality: who pays the ferryman?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/network-neutrality-who-pays-the-ferryman/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2006 13:54:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/network-neutrality-who-pays-the-ferryman/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Network neutrality has become the topic of intense discussion and legislative action.&lt;br&gt;
See the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/21/AR2006012100094.html&#34;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; , a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality&#34;&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.circleid.com/posts/network_neutrality/&#34;&gt;CircelID&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the issue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand people argue for &amp;lsquo;universal service&amp;rsquo; that say that one person&amp;rsquo;s bits should not be treated differently from another person&amp;rsquo;s. This compares to the idea that the phone company should not be allowed to treat your calls differently depending on what you want to say, or that red haired people would have a different monthly fee. There are laws against this type of discrimination (at least in most nations), and some people want to extend this law to Internet traffic. On the other hand there are some Internet providers who want to charge different customers different rates for different service. &amp;ldquo;We can&amp;rsquo;t have companies freeloading on our expensive pipes&amp;rdquo;, they claim.
Clearly we seem to want both. We don&amp;rsquo;t want the phone companies to decide which traffic gets carried, and we also don’t want a bland one-size-fits-all service that is expensive for some and inadequate for others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
