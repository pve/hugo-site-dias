      <title>Positions of Power in IT</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the aspirations of &amp;lsquo;Digital Infrastructures at Scale&amp;rsquo; is to give you tools to influence the professional situation in which you find yourself.
A situation where your objective is to effect a certain transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two major examples of positions of power in IT are architects and auditors/assessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An IT architect likes to create new stuff. Think of a new application that allows business users to work more effectively, for example a new customer relationship management (CRM) system. It is a piece of technology, but it will also be accompanied by new workflows and ways of working together, if it is to be succesful. It is a new technical and social reality in which new things are possible in an organisation.
Other IT architects like to create, for example, digital infrastructures that will enable the faster deployment of such applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What are the AI digital infrastructures?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/digital-inf-ai/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The AI landscape has many digital infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s explain this step by step and focus on which data is stored where, and how it is processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A core element of AI systems is a trained model. At least that is true for the dominant AI form these days: deep learning neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trained model is the result of processing a lot of training data by a specific neural network. These models are fixed in size, but typically very big. The smallest useful models are close to a Gigabyte, while recent public chat models run into multiple Terabytes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Can We Achieve Autonomy Over Our Digital Infrastructures?</title>

&lt;p&gt;In the Netherlands, we are currently engaged in a heated debate about the undesirable dominance of big tech, particularly over a significant portion of the digital infrastructure of the Dutch government. This includes email, file storage, and many other forms of digital storage and processing—most of which are handled by American big tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure a similar debate is going on in many other countries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Preface</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is hardly a book on digital technology, but more on the organisational and societal impact of managing this at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a better understanding of digital technology I highly recommend Brian Kernighan’s “Understanding the Digital World”. () And if you want to have fun while learning how to understand software, I’d highly recommend “The Nature of Code” by Daniel Schiffman ().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you will find out in this book, I am putting on some very specific lenses to look at the world. You may find them restrictive; you may find them arbitrary(?), you may find them opiniated. Yes, this specific way of looking at the effects of digital technology has its limits. However, the essence of understanding is to be able to extract the core elements out of something. Paradoxically, only by restricting the way we look at things can we see more clearly. Cut through the noise. Like Goethe said: “In der Beschränkung zeigt sich erst der Meister”, though he applied that to a different subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Retrofitting Zero Trust on an existing application: an illustration</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/retrofitting-zero-trust-existing-application/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zero Trust Architecture is an approach to better cybersecurity. To many, it seems daunting to implement. But it does not have to be hard to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this hypothetical situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have an application with hundreds of thousands of sensitive records, let’s say client records. We assume that in this example it seems hard to implement MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) on it. What other controls can you implement to reduce the assumed trust? We can use the Kipling method, which is at the core of Zero Trust architectures, to engineer better controls. In short, the Kipling method is about the &amp;lsquo;who&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;what&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;when&amp;rsquo;, etcetera of allowed communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-digital-infrastructures-at-scale-create-value-power-and-risk&#34;&gt;How Digital Infrastructures at scale create value, power, and risk.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-field-guide&#34;&gt;A field guide&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet is a digital infrastructure at scale. Let’s unpack that for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is digital, because it moves bits between devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is at scale, because it moves these bits between billions of devices ranging from websites to mobile phones to robot lawn mowers. (how many?) That is impressive technology, but what keeps that together is the infrastructure part of it. That is what defines the relation between the consumers and the providers, and that is what we are exploring here, as I will show you later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Multiple Ways to Go Cloud</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/three-ways-to-go-cloud/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/three-ways-to-go-cloud/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Public cloud migrations come in different shapes and sizes, but I see three major approaches. Each of these has very different technical and governance implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;three-approaches&#34;&gt;Three approaches&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies dying to get rid of their data centers often get started on a &lt;strong&gt;‘lift and shift’&lt;/strong&gt; approach, where applications are moved from existing servers to equivalent servers in the cloud. The cloud service model consumed here is mainly IaaS (infrastructure as a service). Not much is outsourced to cloud providers here. Contrast that with SaaS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
