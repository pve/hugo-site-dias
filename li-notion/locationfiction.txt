Does the region or availability zone of a cloud provider matter from a security standpoint? 

While we know that there are differences in versions and feature sets between regions in, for example, Amazon Web Services, they all follow the same operational procedures,
As a result, they are likely to face the same risks.
This leads to the idea that they all have the same security.

Does geographic location matter from a compliance perspective?
The same operational procedures are at work, and it all falls under the same management.
In a cloud world, I see no realistic difference in the power that a sovereign state has over the data in a cloud zone in their own territory versus that in another jurisdiction.
In my opinion, the idea that geographic location has any significance is therefore a legal fiction.

From a compliance perspective, that fiction is a reality that we have to deal with, one way or another.

But we may be better off looking at control over the management and ownership of a cloud provider than at its geographical footprint.
