AI involves many parties, with many services that depend on each other.
That brings security challenges that we know from cloud security.

Both in AI and cloud computing, different actors have different roles, and provide complementary services.
That includes responsibilities for security, and it brings to mind shared responsibilities models.

I have seen little guidance in that area, which is why I am developing a risk allocation model.
It maps the risks and controls of the OWASP LLM top 10 risks document to specific roles.

To make it more accessible, it is in the form of a navigable web page.
