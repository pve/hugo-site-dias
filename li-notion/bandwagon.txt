Everybody suddenly seems to be an experienced AI expert these days.
How is that possible?

Sometimes I wonder if we as an industry are just jumping on a bandwagon, blindly following the newest fad, and today it is genAI.
With that I can even feel some guilt that we are just following buzzwords.

But when I have had a good night's rest and reflect on how we got here, I have a more positive image.

Technology has a life of its own, and it progresses autonomously.
None of us has individually invented this.
We are all standing on the shoulders of those who were before us.

We are contributing what we are capable of.
The difference is in having access to fundamental concepts in IT that don't change over the years.
The 'new' thing in IT is rarely different from doing the same all over again, but with different means.
And that is what makes the difference.

Those whose mental model is good can adjust to this much quicker.
Those who just picked up a bunch of hype terms will have a harder time.

If you want to enrich your mental model, you can read about the concepts that I have found to be useful across many decades of IT innovation in my book.
