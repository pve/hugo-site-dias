What I particularly like about promise theory is that it allows us to understand and explain complex interactions in IT systems, independent of whether the participants in that interaction are machines, humans, or humanoid agents.

The cases where I have used it range from business interactions, e-commerce, and system administration, to service management.

It has allowed me to unlock collaboration in complex supply chains.

Promise theory is one of the few fundamental thoughts that I elaborate in my book: Digital Power: how digital infrastructures at scale lead to value, power, and risk.
