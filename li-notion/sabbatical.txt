After more than 40 years in IT, I thought it was time for a sabbatical.

As of next week, I am scaling down my professional activities for half a year.
Instead I plan to travel a lot.

But as my experience shows, I will probably still be doing some professional reading and exploring.
I am not committing to anything, but I'd also really like to take the time to expand on my book.

You don't have to wait for it to be complete. You can already read the current version at https://digitalinfrastructures.nl

Would love to have your feedback on the book, it helps me focus.
